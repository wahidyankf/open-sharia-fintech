🏗️ Strategic Pivot: Architecture First, Then Services

Week 9 shifts to architecture exploration via the C4 model before building services—bootstrapped dolphin-be prototype (now paused) and completed repository-wide quality improvements.

What Changed (Week 9 vs Week 8):

📐 C4 Architecture: STARTED

Starting C4 model exploration (Context, Container, Component, Code) to establish a clear architecture first. Added comprehensive guide and initial system diagrams. It will guide all future service design.

🚀 Dolphin-BE: PAUSED

Bootstrapped Learning Management System (Spring Boot 4.0, Java 25) with basic health checks and tests. Paused to complete the C4 architecture first. Will resume after architecture clarity.

📂 Repository Organization: ENHANCED

Renamed rules/ to repo-governance/ at root for clarity. Contains 6-layer hierarchy (Vision → Principles → Conventions → Development → Agents → Workflows).

📝 Markdown Quality: NEW

Implemented markdownlint-cli2 with zero violations. Added lint scripts (lint:md, lint:md: fix, format:md).

🔄 Tooling: CLAUDE CODE PRIMARY

Returning to Claude Code as primary. OpenCode with GLM-4.7 (Z.AI) proved slow in practice. OpenCode Zen is promising, but the pay-per-use pricing may be expensive. Will reassess in 3 months (April 2026).

🎯 OpenCode Evaluation: COMPLETED

Successfully migrated to GLM-4.7 with MCP servers, but performance issues emerged (e.g., response time, code generation quality). Stepping back to Claude Code, maintaining compatibility for quarterly reassessment.

🖥️ Development Infrastructure: MIGRATED

Migrated development workflow from local machine → cloud devbox → home server devbox. Using a home server, Ansible, and Cloudflare was really fun and cut costs significantly. Bonus: can make AI run "24/7" for autonomous tasks.

What's Next:

Complete C4 Container/Component diagrams for dolphin suite (LMS, middleware, IAM). Resume dolphin-be after architecture clarity. OpenCode reassessment April 2026.
