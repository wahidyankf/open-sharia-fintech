# Worktree Path: Cleanup, Multiple Worktrees, Tools, and References

## Worktree Cleanup

When removing a worktree:

1. Resolve the declared repository-relative route from the plan's Provisioned Worktree Identity
   against the selected repository root, then reconcile the resulting runtime path with `git
worktree list --porcelain`. Inventory every plan-created and current branch from the Delivery
   Branch Inventory and `git -C <resolved-runtime-path> branch --show-current`; a missing identity, path
   conflict, or unclassified branch blocks removal.
2. Apply the canonical [mandatory pre-removal checks](../../../development/workflow/worktree-and-artifact-cleanup/mandatory-pre-removal-checks.md): each PR-mode branch needs its exact merged-PR/head
   proof plus either a matching live `origin/<branch>` tip or a verified GitHub automatic-deletion
   event when the repository enables it; direct-push entries need their recorded commit on
   `origin/main` and no open PR. Any other missing/mismatched proof retains and escalates; do not
   use `origin/main` ancestry for a squash-merged PR branch.
3. Verify the resolved worktree is clean and idle (`git -C <resolved-runtime-path> status --porcelain`) and every
   inventoried branch has no unpushed commit.
4. When every check passes, purge only plan-local regenerable build output while preserving
   diagnostic evidence and shared caches. For a bare repository whose push hook requires a working
   tree, clean verified live remote branches from inside the linked worktree before removal. Then
   immediately run non-force `git worktree remove <resolved-runtime-path>`, complete the canonical
   [branch cleanup](../../../development/workflow/worktree-and-artifact-cleanup/branch-cleanup.md),
   and run `git worktree prune`. If any check or removal fails, retain the worktree and evidence and
   escalate; never force removal or prompt for an otherwise eligible exact plan path.

For plan worktrees, the [plan-execution workflow](../../../workflows/plan/plan-execution.md) performs
this cleanup immediately when that repo's delivery is confirmed. It never removes a root, wildcard,
identity-unknown, or another actor's worktree.

**Plan delivery checklist tagging**: when any of these three commands — `git worktree add`, the push (to the PR branch under the default `worktree-to-pr`, or `git push origin main` under a direct-push mode), or `git worktree remove` — appear as steps in a plan delivery checklist, they MUST be tagged `[AI]`. Tagging them `[HUMAN]` incorrectly creates a hand-off gate where none exists. See [Plans Organization Convention §Executor Tagging](../plans/executor-tagging-tags-and-bias.md#executor-tagging--ai-vs-human-hard-rule) and the [Git Push Default Convention](../../../development/workflow/git-push-default.md) for the canonical rule statement and FAIL/PASS examples.

## Multiple Worktrees

The pattern supports multiple concurrent worktrees belonging to different plans or repositories;
each plan remains capped at **at most one worktree per repository**:

```
worktrees/
├── feature-auth/
├── bugfix-session-timeout/
└── experiment-new-api/
```

## Tools and Automation

Reference agents or tools that interact with this convention:

- **WorktreeCreate hook** (`.claude/hooks/worktree-create.sh`) — Routes `claude --worktree` to custom path
- **rules-checker** — Validates worktree-related rules and gitignore compliance
