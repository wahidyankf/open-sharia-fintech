# Structure Conventions

Documentation organization frameworks, file naming, and project planning structure. These conventions answer the question: **"How do I ORGANIZE documentation?"**

## Purpose

This directory contains standards for how documentation is organized, named, and structured across the repository. These conventions establish the foundational frameworks that govern documentation architecture.

## Documents

- [Agent Naming Convention](./agent-naming.md) - Single exception-free filename rule for agent files in `.claude/agents/` and `.opencode/agents/`. Defines scope vocabulary, role vocabulary (maker, checker, fixer, dev, deployer, manager), and the audit command enforced by `repo-rules-checker`
- [App README vs Specs Convention](./app-readme-vs-specs.md) - Defines what content lives in app/infra READMEs vs `specs/` (Category A dev-runtime vs Category B behavior/architecture), the C4-aware five-folder spec tree shape, the PM-readability contract for spec files, and BDD/DDD/Contracts adoption expectations by surface profile
- [Governance Vendor-Independence Convention](./governance-vendor-independence.md) - Requires all `repo-governance/` prose to be vendor-neutral. Defines forbidden vendor terms, `binding-example` fence allowlist, vocabulary map (vendor → neutral replacements), platform-binding directory pattern, and migration guidance.
- [Multi-Harness Binding Convention](./multi-harness-binding.md) - Keeps one canonical root instruction surface while supporting many coding-agent harnesses. Defines the two-tier binding model (native readers vs. bridge-required), the no-shadowing rule, mechanical generation, and the deterministic pre-push parity guard.
- [Diataxis Framework](./diataxis-framework.md) - Understanding the four-category documentation organization framework we use (Tutorials, How-To, Reference, Explanation). Foundational framework for all documentation structure
- [Deterministic vs AI Validation Split](./deterministic-vs-ai-validation-split.md) - Defines which governance validation categories run as deterministic preflight (mechanical predicates, milliseconds, cached) vs AI checker (semantic judgement) and the JSON envelope contract between the two layers. **Agents**: repo-rules-checker
- [File Naming Convention](./file-naming.md) - Kebab-case filename rules for docs/, repo-governance/, and plans/ directories
- [Instruction-File Size Budget Convention](./instruction-file-size-budget.md) - Per-surface byte thresholds for auto-loaded instruction files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, harness-specific surfaces). Enforced by `rhino-cli harness instruction-size validate` at pre-push, pre-commit, CI, and as `repo-governance audit` category 4. Sole sanctioned remediation: progressive disclosure.
- [Learning-Plan `syllabus/` Folder Convention](./learning-plan-syllabus.md) - Defines the learning-bearing plan trigger, the required `syllabus/courses/` + `syllabus/paths/` folder layout, the measured section-tiering derivation (REQUIRED/RECOMMENDED/OPTIONAL), the copy-paste course template, the `## Corpus Disposition` values (`archive-with-plan` default, `promote-to:<path>`, `custodied-by:<plan-id>`), and the single-custodian custody rule for learning-path plans
- [Per-Directory Licensing](./licensing.md) - Standards for the per-directory licensing strategy using MIT for all code in this repository
- [Plans Organization](./plans.md) - Standards for organizing project planning documents in plans/ folder including structure (ideas/, backlog/, in-progress/, done/), naming patterns (YYYY-MM-DD\_\_identifier/), lifecycle stages, and project identifiers
- [Post-Mortem Convention](./post-mortems.md) - Standards for blameless incident post-mortems: location (`docs/explanation/post-mortems/`), `YYYY-MM-DD-<system>-<short-failure>.md` naming, mandatory sections, the authoritative Sev-1..Sev-4 severity scale, action-item tracking, and `doc_status` lifecycle. Software-incident framing (CI/CD, Vercel outages, dependency-bump and parity-guard regressions)
- [Programming Language Documentation Separation](./programming-language-docs-separation.md) - Establishes clear separation between repository-specific programming language style guides (docs/explanation/) and educational content (ayokoding-www). Defines scope boundaries, prerequisite requirements, cross-referencing patterns, and DRY principle application
- [Specs Directory Structure](./specs-directory-structure.md) - Canonical C4-aware five-folder directory structure for `specs/apps/<app-family>/` — `product/`, `system-context/`, `containers/`, `components/`, `behavior/`. Defines per-surface variants (full-stack, web-only, CLI-only, multi-CLI), Gherkin domain subdirectory rules, migration path from flat-root layouts, and deterministic validation via `rhino-cli specs` commands. Cross-links to [App README vs Specs Convention](./app-readme-vs-specs.md) as the combined source of truth.
- [No Manual Date Metadata Convention](./no-date-metadata.md) - Non-website markdown files must not contain manual date metadata: no `updated:` frontmatter, no `**Last Updated**` footer blocks, no inline body date annotations. Git history is authoritative.
- [No Last Updated Convention](./no-last-updated.md) - Superseded stub — redirects to No Manual Date Metadata Convention
- [Workflow Naming Convention](./workflow-naming.md) - Single exception-free filename rule for workflow files under `repo-governance/workflows/` (except `meta/` reference docs). Defines scope vocabulary, type vocabulary (quality-gate, execution, setup), and the audit command enforced by `repo-rules-checker` and `rhino-cli repo-governance workflows naming validate`
- [Worktree Path Convention](./worktree-path.md) - Defines the worktree directory structure, naming convention, and gitignore requirements for `claude --worktree` routing in this repository

## Key Concepts

### Diataxis Categories

| Category    | Purpose              | User Need            |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Tutorials   | Learning-oriented    | "Help me learn"      |
| How-To      | Problem-solving      | "Help me do X"       |
| Reference   | Information-oriented | "Give me the facts"  |
| Explanation | Understanding        | "Help me understand" |

### File Naming Pattern

Files use kebab-case names describing their content (e.g., `getting-started.md`, `configure-api.md`). Category is conveyed by directory location, not filename prefixes. `README.md` is used for directory index files.

### Plans Lifecycle

```
ideas/ → backlog/ → in-progress/ → done/
```

## Principles Implemented/Respected

This set of conventions implements/respects the following core principles:

- **[Documentation First](../../principles/content/documentation-first.md)**: The Diataxis Framework establishes a systematic four-category documentation structure, making documentation a primary deliverable rather than an afterthought. Plans Organization convention ensures planning work is documented in structured, discoverable locations.

- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: Plans naming patterns (stage-aware: `identifier/` in backlog/in-progress, `YYYY-MM-DD__identifier/` in done) make lifecycle stage explicit in folder names. File Naming Convention uses descriptive kebab-case names so a filename clearly communicates the content without abbreviation lookups.

- **[Simplicity Over Complexity](../../principles/general/simplicity-over-complexity.md)**: The four Diataxis categories provide a complete, minimal taxonomy that covers all documentation types without overlap or excessive granularity. File naming uses a single simple kebab-case rule with no prefix encoding to memorize.
