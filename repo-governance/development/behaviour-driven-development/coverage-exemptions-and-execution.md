# BDD Coverage, Exemptions, and Execution

This document extends the canonical
[BDD standard](../behaviour-driven-development.md) with its coverage and execution contract.

## Higher-Layer Exemptions

Implement Integration and E2E by default whenever their boundaries can express the scenario. A
scenario may carry `@integration-exempt`, `@e2e-exempt`, or both. Each tag requires its own comment
immediately above that tag:

```gherkin
# Exemption(integration): pure in-process calculation has no real local-resource boundary; alternative-proof: finance:test:unit / Calculates fee from amount
@integration-exempt
# Exemption(e2e): library exposes no public browser, HTTP, or process boundary; alternative-proof: finance:test:unit / Calculates fee from amount
@e2e-exempt
Scenario: Calculates fee from amount
  Given an amount of 100 USD
  When the fee is calculated at 2 percent
  Then the fee should be 2 USD
```

Review two exemptions independently. The reason must describe why the layer boundary fundamentally
cannot express the scenario. Difficulty, runtime, speed, flakiness, cost, expense, `TODO`, missing
implementation, and unfinished work are invalid reasons. The named unexempted target and scenario
must substantively prove the omitted concern, and Unit must still prove the behaviour. Never place
an exemption on Feature, Rule, or Background; never use `@unit-exempt`, `@no-*`, positive
layer-selection tags, or `@wip`; never exempt every available proof.

## Runtime and Static Coverage Targets

- `test:unit`, `test:integration`, and `test:e2e` execute only their named runtime layer.
- `test:coverage:unit`, `test:coverage:integration`, `test:coverage:e2e`, and
  `test:coverage:behaviour` validate test/corpus coverage statically. They must not execute or
  depend directly or transitively on any runtime `test:*` target.
- `test:coverage` aggregates every applicable static coverage target. Every applicable validator is
  mandatory in `test:quick`, either directly or through that aggregate.
- `test:quick` runs `typecheck`, `lint`, `test:unit`, and every applicable static coverage
  validator. A dedicated E2E project omits `test:unit`. Integration and E2E runtime must never be
  reachable from `test:quick`.

Every behaviour-owning source project's `test:unit` collects native line coverage and hard-fails
below 99%. A dedicated E2E project does not own Unit and never waives its source owner's threshold.
An explicitly enumerated boundary adapter may leave the Unit denominator only when it is wholly a
resource, process, generated-code, or static-data boundary and named Integration or E2E runtime
proof exercises it. Keep exclusions to named files or narrow functions. Broad path globs, mixed
core-logic exclusions, and boundary code without higher-layer proof are forbidden.

Static coverage proves exact recursive corpus membership, complete applicable adapters,
exactly-one bindings, no unused bindings, valid exemption syntax, and mandatory Unit proof. It does
not prove semantic implementation or execute tests. Runtime code-coverage instrumentation and its
threshold belong to the corresponding runtime test target, never a `test:coverage:*` validator.

## Execution Surfaces

Pre-commit runs deterministic staged-file checks only. Pre-push runs affected `test:quick` targets
with `--parallel=1`. PR/main quality gates may use explicitly bounded project parallelism suitable
for their shard, while each project's quick target preserves its ordered composition. Neither
surface runs Integration or E2E runtime. During development and review, run impacted
Integration/E2E scenarios manually; widen uncertainty to the affected project, not automatically
to the whole workspace. Scheduled and manually dispatched full-quality CI runs every applicable
static coverage validator, then complete Integration suites, then complete unfiltered E2E suites.
All paths fail closed.
