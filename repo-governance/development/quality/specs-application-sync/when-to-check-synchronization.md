# When to Check Synchronization

Check and update specs in the same commit as the application change for:

- Adding, removing, or renaming an application (`apps/`, `libs/`)
- Changing framework or runtime technology for an existing application
- Adding or removing a REST endpoint, tRPC procedure, GraphQL resolver, or equivalent API surface
- Adding or removing a major UI page or route
- Introducing a new data store or removing an existing one
- Adding or removing an external integration that appears in the C4 context or container diagram
- Adding or removing a CLI command (covered by the tool owner's mandatory static
  `test:coverage:*` targets and semantic review)
- Changing deployment target in a way that creates a new architectural boundary

Do **not** update specs for:

- Bug fixes that do not change the observable API contract (the behaviour described in specs was already the intended behaviour)
- Styling changes, layout adjustments, or purely visual changes with no behavioural impact
- Internal refactors that do not change public interfaces, API contracts, or architectural boundaries
- Dependency version upgrades that do not change behaviour visible to consumers
- Performance optimizations with unchanged interfaces
- Test-internal changes (renaming a test helper, restructuring mocks) that do not change what is tested
