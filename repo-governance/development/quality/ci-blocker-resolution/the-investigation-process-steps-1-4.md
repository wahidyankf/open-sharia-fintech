# The Investigation Process (Steps 1-4)

## Step 1: Read the Error

Read the full error output. Not just the summary line -- the full stack trace, the full lint output, the full test failure message. The root cause is in the details.

## Step 2: Identify the Blast Radius

Determine which projects are affected:

```bash
# See which projects are affected by your changes (test:quick internally chains
# types/lint -> test:unit -> every applicable static test:coverage:*; see Nx Target Standards)
npx nx affected -t test:quick --dry-run
```

If a project you did not modify is failing, it is a preexisting issue. Your changes did not cause it, but you are responsible for fixing it because you discovered it.

## Step 3: Reproduce the Failure

Reproduce the failure in isolation to confirm it is preexisting:

```bash
# Run the specific failing target for the specific project
npx nx run <project>:typecheck
npx nx run <project>:lint
npx nx run <project>:test:quick
npx nx run <project>:test:coverage:behaviour
```

## Step 4: Trace to Root Cause

Common root causes of preexisting CI failures:

| A gate or test fails in the primary checkout while CI is green | Local-only contamination, not a defect in `origin/main`. Three known causes: stale `dist/` build output (use `--skip-nx-cache`; a plain build reports "outputs match the cache" and refreshes nothing, and the .NET apphost launcher is byte-identical across builds, so hashing it proves nothing -- stat the DLLs); a nested worktree, which filesystem-walking gates count as a second copy of every tracked file while `git status` stays clean; and a gitignored build artifact carrying a `project.json`, which Nx discovers because project discovery does not read `.gitignore`. Reproduce inside a worktree or read CI first -- contamination only ever adds findings, so a green local run still counts |
