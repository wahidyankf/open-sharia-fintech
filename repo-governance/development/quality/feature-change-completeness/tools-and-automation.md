# Tools and Automation

- **Project-local `test:coverage:*` targets**: Statically enforce exact scenario-to-adapter mapping
  and exemption syntax. The aggregate `test:coverage` target is mandatory in `test:quick` and never
  executes tests.
- **`codegen` Nx target**: Generates types from OpenAPI specs. Stale contracts cause `typecheck` to fail.
- **Runtime coverage thresholds**: Each native `test:unit` target enforces its project's numeric
  coverage floor; static `test:coverage:*` targets do not consume runtime reports.
- **Nx cache inputs**: Gherkin specs are declared as inputs for test targets, invalidating caches when specs change.
- **`rules-checker`**: Validates that specs folders exist for apps that require them.
