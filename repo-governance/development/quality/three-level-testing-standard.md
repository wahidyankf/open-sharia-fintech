# Unit, Integration, and E2E Testing Standard

## Principles Implemented/Respected

- [Pure Functions](../../principles/software-engineering/pure-functions.md) — Unit tests keep real
  resource boundaries behind injected ports.
- [Explicit over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md) — each
  test layer owns a distinct, named boundary.

## Conventions Implemented/Respected

- [Specs Directory Structure](../../conventions/structure/specs-directory-structure.md) — runtime
  adapters consume the owner's canonical Gherkin corpus.
- [Repository Working Language](../../conventions/writing/repository-working-language.md) — active
  test documentation uses British `behaviour` terminology.

The canonical [Behaviour-Driven Development standard](../behaviour-driven-development.md) defines
the repository's Unit, Integration, and E2E boundaries; project-role applicability; shared Gherkin
contract; static coverage validators; exemptions; and execution surfaces.

This entry point remains for discoverability from older testing references. It does not establish a
second testing contract. In particular:

- every active scenario requires Unit proof and Unit has no exemption;
- Integration and E2E apply only when the project role owns their real boundary;
- inapplicable targets are omitted, never implemented as no-op or echo placeholders;
- `test:*` executes tests while `test:coverage:*` validates coverage statically without executing
  tests;
- every applicable static coverage target runs through `test:quick`; and
- Integration/E2E runtime stays out of pre-commit, pre-push, PR/main quality gates, and
  `test:quick`.

Use the [coverage, exemption, and execution contract](../behaviour-driven-development/coverage-exemptions-and-execution.md)
for the canonical higher-layer exemption syntax and runtime-surface rules.
