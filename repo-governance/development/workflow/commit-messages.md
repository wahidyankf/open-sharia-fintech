# Commit Message Convention

<!--
  MAINTENANCE NOTE: Master reference for commit message format
  This is duplicated (intentionally) in multiple files for different audiences:
  1. repo-governance/development/workflow/commit-messages.md (this file - comprehensive reference)
  2. AGENTS.md (quick reference for AI agents)
  When updating, synchronize both locations.

This document explains the commit message convention used in the open-sharia-enterprise project, why we use it, and how it's enforced. Understanding commit messages helps maintain a clean, navigable project history that benefits all contributors.
