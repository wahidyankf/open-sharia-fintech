# TDD Shape for Delivery Checklists

Every code-shipping outcome section preserves RED → GREEN → REFACTOR as separate, ordered,
independently verifiable checkboxes. The section keeps them tied to one acceptance criterion and
observable outcome; the checkboxes keep progress, commands, and evidence visible to a junior
engineer with no professional experience.

```markdown
### AC-### — [cohesive behaviour outcome]

- **Input:** canonical acceptance-criterion reference, prerequisites, and affected scope.
- **Outcome:** [observable behaviour].
- [ ] [AI] **RED:** write `[test path and exact case]`; run `[copyable focused command]`;
      acceptance: it fails for `[expected missing behaviour or diagnostic]` and existing unrelated tests
      remain green; save output at `[evidence destination]`.
- [ ] [AI] **GREEN:** implement `[exact symbol]` in `[source path]`; run `[copyable focused command]`;
      acceptance: the new test passes and no unrelated focused case regresses.
- [ ] [AI] **REFACTOR:** clean up `[specific concern/path]`; run `[focused and regression commands]`;
      acceptance: behaviour, public contract, and expected diagnostics remain unchanged.
- **Proof:** RED evidence plus the passing focused and regression outputs.
```

If one outcome needs several TDD cycles, write a separate RED/GREEN/REFACTOR checkbox trio for each
independently testable behaviour slice inside that outcome section. Do not collapse cycles to keep the
checklist short. Every RED checkbox names what must fail and why; “test fails” alone is insufficient.

Non-code outcome sections do not require RED-GREEN-REFACTOR. Each independently verifiable action is
still its own detailed checkbox.

```markdown
### [Outcome]

- **Input:** [source, prerequisites, and scope].
- **Outcome:** [observable state].
- [ ] [AI] Update `[exact path/section]`; acceptance: `[observable result]`; verify with
      `[copyable inspection or gate]`; save evidence at `[destination]` when the result is not committed.
- **Proof:** [final section-level gate].
```

`plan-checker` flags a code outcome that combines or omits RED, GREEN, or REFACTOR checkboxes; lacks
exact paths, commands, expected observations, or proof; or separates those actions into unrelated
outcome sections. It also flags micro-checkboxes that expose keystrokes rather than independently
verifiable work.

These RED/GREEN/REFACTOR actions are `[AI]` work — each checkbox carries the `[AI]`/`[HUMAN]`
executor tag, and the phase they belong to ends with a `### Phase N Gate` plus a Pause Safety note,
per [Plans Organization Convention §Executor Tagging](../../../conventions/structure/plans/executor-tagging-tags-and-bias.md#executor-tagging--ai-vs-human-hard-rule)
and [§Phases as Natural Pauses With Clear Gates](../../../conventions/structure/plans/phases-as-natural-pauses.md#phases-as-natural-pauses-with-clear-gates-hard-rule).
