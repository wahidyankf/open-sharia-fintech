# PDF-to-Markdown Quality Gate Workflow

**Purpose**: Convert a PDF file to a complete, verbatim Markdown representation, then validate
conversion fidelity iteratively until all issues are resolved. The resulting Markdown serves as a
cross-reference source-of-truth proxy for the original PDF.

**When to use**:

- When converting a new PDF document to Markdown for archival or cross-referencing
- After manually editing a PDF-derived Markdown file (verify fidelity was not lost)
- When validating an existing conversion before using it as a reference source
- After a PDF has been updated and the Markdown needs revalidation

This workflow implements the **Maker-Checker-Fixer pattern** for PDF-to-Markdown conversion quality
assurance.

## Execution Mode

**Preferred Mode**: Agent Delegation — invoke `pdf-to-md-maker`, `pdf-to-md-checker`, and
`pdf-to-md-fixer` via the Agent tool with `subagent_type`
(see [Workflow Execution Modes Convention](../meta/execution-modes.md)).

**Fallback Mode**: Manual Orchestration — execute workflow logic directly using Read/Write/Edit/Bash
tools when Agent Delegation is unavailable.

**How to Execute**:

```
User: "Run pdf-to-md quality gate for docs/reference/security/nist-sp-800-53-rev5.pdf"
```

The AI will:

1. Check if Markdown file exists (skip maker if it does, unless force-remake=true)
2. Invoke `pdf-to-md-maker` via the Agent tool (convert PDF → Markdown)
3. Invoke `pdf-to-md-checker` via the Agent tool (validate fidelity, write audit)
4. Invoke `pdf-to-md-fixer` via the Agent tool (read audit, apply fixes)
5. Iterate until zero findings achieved on two consecutive checks
6. Show git status with modified files
7. Wait for user commit approval

**Fallback (Manual Mode)**:

```
User: "Run pdf-to-md quality gate for nist.pdf in manual mode"
```

The AI executes checker and fixer logic directly using Bash (pdftotext) and Read/Write/Edit tools.

## Steps

### 1. Generate Markdown (Conditional)

Convert the PDF to Markdown. Skipped if MD file already exists AND `force-remake=false`.

**Condition**: Run if `md-file` does not exist OR `force-remake=true`

**Agent**: `pdf-to-md-maker`

- **Args**: `pdf-file: {input.pdf-file}, md-file: {input.md-file}`
- **Output**: Markdown file at `{input.md-file}` (or derived default path)

**Success criteria**: Maker completes without error; MD file exists and is non-empty.

**On failure**: Terminate workflow with status `fail`. Common failure causes:

- `pdftotext` (poppler-utils) not installed
- `tesseract` not installed for image-only PDFs
- Source PDF is corrupt or unreadable

**Notes**:

- Text-based PDFs: uses `pdftotext -layout` in 50-page chunks
- Image-only PDFs: uses `pdfimages` + `tesseract` OCR per page; OCR pages tagged `<!-- OCR: page N -->`
- Diagrams/figures: converted to Mermaid stubs or `[FIGURE N: ...]` placeholders
- Default output path: same directory and filename as PDF, `.md` extension
- **Directory creation**: if `md-file` parent directory does not exist, maker runs `mkdir -p`
  before writing — applies to custom output paths; the default path (same dir as PDF) always
  exists and is a no-op
- **Heading level inference**: maker uses `pdftotext -layout` font-size heuristics and section
  numbering depth (e.g. `1.2.3` = H3) to assign the correct `#` depth — title = H1, top-level
  chapters/parts = H2, sections = H3, subsections = H4, sub-subsections = H5
- **Content nesting inference**: list indentation depth from PDF layout output is preserved;
  nested bullets and numbered lists carry the correct nesting level into Markdown

### 2. Validate Fidelity (Sequential)

Validate the Markdown file against the source PDF across all dimensions.

**Agent**: `pdf-to-md-checker`

- **Args**: `pdf-file: {input.pdf-file}, md-file: {input.md-file}, EXECUTION_SCOPE: pdf-to-md`
- **Output**: `{pdf-to-md-report-N}` — fidelity audit report

**Success criteria**: Checker completes and generates audit report.

**On failure**: Terminate workflow with status `fail`.

**Validation dimensions**:

- **Text completeness** — no PDF passages missing from Markdown
- **Text accuracy** — no words changed or incorrectly transcribed
- **Heading level accuracy** — `#` depth of every heading matches the PDF visual hierarchy
  (title = H1, chapter/part = H2, section = H3, subsection = H4, sub-subsection = H5); derived
  from font-size heuristics and section-numbering depth in `pdftotext -layout` output
- **Content nesting accuracy** — list nesting depth and indented block elements match PDF
  structure; nested bullets and numbered lists carry the correct level into Markdown
- **Table integrity** — all tables present with correct data
- **Figure coverage** — every figure has Mermaid or placeholder
- **Mermaid validity** — all Mermaid blocks have valid syntax
- **OCR quality** — image-only pages have acceptable error rate (<10%)
- **Structural order** — sections appear in PDF reading order

**Notes**:

- Processes PDF in 50-page chunks for large documents
- Loads `generated-reports/.known-false-positives.md` skip list before validating

### 3. Check for Findings (Sequential)

Analyze audit report to determine if fixes are needed and track convergence progress.

**Condition Check**: Count findings based on mode level in `{step2.outputs.pdf-to-md-report-N}`

**Mode-based counting**:

- **lax**: Count CRITICAL only
- **normal**: Count CRITICAL + HIGH
- **strict**: Count CRITICAL + HIGH + MEDIUM
- **ocd**: Count all levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

**Below-threshold findings**: Reported in audit but don't block success.

**Decision**:

- If threshold-level findings > 0: Proceed to step 4 (reset `consecutive_zero_count` to 0)
- If threshold-level findings = 0: Initialize `consecutive_zero_count` to 1 (this check is the
  first zero); proceed to step 5 (Re-validate) for confirmation re-check (consecutive pass
  requirement)

**Depends on**: Step 2 completion

### 4. Apply Fixes (Sequential, Conditional)

Apply validated fixes from the checker audit report.

**Agent**: `pdf-to-md-fixer`

- **Args**: `report: {step2.outputs.pdf-to-md-report-N}, pdf-file: {input.pdf-file}, md-file: {input.md-file}, mode: {input.mode}`
- **Output**: `{pdf-to-md-fix-report-N}` — fix application report with same UUID chain
- **Condition**: Threshold-level findings > 0 from step 3

**Fix scope by mode**:

- **lax**: Fix CRITICAL only (skip HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- **normal**: Fix CRITICAL + HIGH (skip MEDIUM/LOW)
- **strict**: Fix CRITICAL + HIGH + MEDIUM (skip LOW)
- **ocd**: Fix all levels

**Success criteria**: Fixer completes; fix report generated.

**On failure**: Log errors; proceed to step 5 (Re-validate).

**Notes**:

- Fixer re-validates each finding before applying (prevents false positives)
- HIGH_CONFIDENCE fixes applied automatically
- MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE fixes skipped (flagged for manual review)
- FALSE_POSITIVE findings persisted to `generated-reports/.known-false-positives.md`
- Fix report includes changed sections list for scoped re-validation

**Confidence Downgrade Rules**:

The fixer MUST downgrade an originally-`HIGH_CONFIDENCE` finding to `MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE`
(and therefore skip auto-application) when any of these conditions hold at fix time:

- **Wide-scope structural restructure** — the fix would mechanically alter more than 10 occurrences
  of the same structural pattern (e.g. changing list nesting depth across many controls,
  re-numbering hundreds of sub-items). Wide-scope mechanical changes carry cascading-side-effect
  risk that warrants per-occurrence human review.
- **Out-of-locus edits** — the fix would touch document regions outside the audit finding's
  `location_md` field. The audit located one problem; the fix should not silently expand its blast
  radius.
- **Conflicting concurrent finding** — a different audit finding's expected fix would touch the
  same span, and the two fixes might collide.

Downgraded findings appear in the fix report under **Skipped (MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE)** with the
downgrade reason cited. See [pdf-to-md-fixer agent definition](../../../.claude/agents/pdf-to-md-fixer.md)
for the binding rule.

### 5. Re-validate (Sequential)

Run the checker again to verify fixes resolved issues and no new issues were introduced.

**Agent**: `pdf-to-md-checker`

- **Args**: `pdf-file: {input.pdf-file}, md-file: {input.md-file}, EXECUTION_SCOPE: pdf-to-md,
uuid-chain: {previous-uuid-chain}, fix-report: {step4.outputs.pdf-to-md-fix-report-N}`
- **Output**: `{pdf-to-md-report-N}` — re-validation audit report
- **Depends on**: Step 3 completion (when confirming a first-zero pass) or Step 4 completion
  (when verifying fixes were applied correctly)

**Re-validation mode**: The UUID chain signals re-validation mode to the checker. When called
after Step 4, the fix report provides the changed sections list — checker validates only changed
sections and reuses the iteration 1 full-document scan scope for unchanged sections. When called
directly from Step 3 (zero-findings confirmation path), no fix report is provided and the checker
re-validates the full document.

**Empty `changed_sections` case**: When the preceding fixer ran with `Applied (HIGH_CONFIDENCE): 0`,
the fix report's `Changed Sections` list is empty. The checker writes a thin **carry-forward audit**
that references the prior audit by UUID and reproduces its findings verbatim — no re-scan. This
satisfies the per-iteration audit requirement at zero scan cost when the fixer's outcome is
deterministically a no-op.

**Success criteria**: Checker completes and generates re-validation audit report.

**On failure**: Terminate workflow with status `fail`.

**Notes**:

- Loads `generated-reports/.known-false-positives.md` skip list before validating
- Scoped re-validation (changed sections only) on iterations where fixes were applied
- Full re-validation when confirming a zero-findings pass with no preceding fix step
- Carry-forward audit (no re-scan) when `changed_sections` is empty after a zero-applied fixer iteration

### 6. Iteration Control (Sequential)

Determine whether to continue or finalize.

**Logic**:

- Track `consecutive_zero_count` across iterations (resets to 0 when threshold-level findings > 0,
  increments when = 0)
- Track `consecutive_zero_fixes` across iterations: read `**Applied (HIGH_CONFIDENCE)**: A` from
  the most recent fix report. Increment when `A = 0`. Reset to 0 when `A > 0`. No fix report this
  iteration (e.g. iteration ran no fixer) leaves the counter unchanged.
- If `consecutive_zero_fixes >= 2`: Proceed to step 7 (**partial** — stagnation exit). Two
  back-to-back fixer runs that applied nothing prove the remaining findings are deterministically
  manual-only; further iteration is wasted work.
- If `consecutive_zero_count >= 2` AND iterations >= min-iterations (or min not provided): Proceed
  to step 7 (double-zero confirmed — **pass**)
- If `consecutive_zero_count >= 2` AND iterations < min-iterations: Loop back to step 5
  (Re-validate to satisfy min-iterations)
- If `consecutive_zero_count < 2` AND threshold-level findings = 0: Loop back to step 5
  (confirmation check — no fix needed, just re-verify)
- If threshold-level findings > 0 AND max-iterations provided AND iterations >= max-iterations:
  Proceed to step 7 (**partial**)
- If threshold-level findings > 0 AND (max-iterations not provided OR iterations < max-iterations):
  Loop back to step 4 (Apply Fixes)

**Below-threshold findings**: Reported in audit but don't affect iteration logic.

**Notes**:

- **Consecutive pass requirement**: Zero findings must be confirmed by a second independent check
  before declaring success
- **Stagnation exit**: When the fixer applies zero `HIGH_CONFIDENCE` fixes on two consecutive
  iterations, the orchestrator terminates `partial` rather than burning the remaining
  max-iterations budget on a deterministic no-op. The fix report's
  `**Applied (HIGH_CONFIDENCE)**: A` line is the canonical signal — no new schema needed.
- **Why two iterations, not one**: A single `Applied=0` could indicate transient causes (crane
  subprocess error, partial fixer crash recovered by retry, race with a concurrent skip-list
  write). Requiring TWO consecutive zero-applied iterations distinguishes deterministic-skip
  stagnation from transient failure. Cost: one extra checker+fixer invocation in the worst
  case (mitigated by the carry-forward audit in Step 5 when `changed_sections` is empty).
  Benefit: no false `partial` exit on transient errors.
- Escalation warning logged at iteration 5 if not converging
- Default max-iterations: 7

### 7. Finalization (Sequential)

Report final status and summary.

**Output**: `{final-status}`, `{iterations-completed}`, `{pdf-to-md-report}`

**Status determination**:

- **pass**: Zero threshold-level findings across all dimensions on 2 consecutive checks
- **partial**: Findings remain after max-iterations; or some fixes require manual intervention
  (e.g., OCR quality disputes)
- **fail**: Technical errors (missing tools, corrupt PDF, empty output)

**Notes**:

- Below-threshold findings reported in final audit but don't prevent success
- Manual intervention cases (e.g., true OCR quality issues) always result in `partial` — re-run
  after manual correction
- Final report includes page coverage, table count, figure count, Mermaid block count

## Termination Criteria

**Success** (`pass`):

- **lax**: Zero CRITICAL findings on 2 consecutive checks (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW may exist)
- **normal**: Zero CRITICAL/HIGH findings on 2 consecutive checks (MEDIUM/LOW may exist)
- **strict**: Zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings on 2 consecutive checks (LOW may exist)
- **ocd**: Zero findings at all levels on 2 consecutive checks

**Partial** (`partial`):

- Threshold-level findings remain after max-iterations
- Some findings require manual intervention (OCR quality, ambiguous diagram type)
- Some fixer operations failed

**Failure** (`fail`):

- Required CLI tool not found (`pdftotext`, `tesseract`)
- Source PDF unreadable or corrupt
- Output MD file could not be written

**Note**: Below-threshold findings are reported in final audit but don't prevent success status.
Success requires two consecutive zero-finding validations (consecutive pass requirement).

## Example Usage

### Standard Invocation

```
User: "Run pdf-to-md quality gate for docs/reference/nist-sp-800-53-rev5.pdf"
```

AI will:

- Check if MD exists; skip maker if it does
- Validate fidelity in strict mode (default)
- Fix CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings
- Iterate until zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings on 2 consecutive checks

### Force Regeneration

```
User: "Run pdf-to-md quality gate for nist.pdf with force-remake=true"
```

AI will:

- Re-run maker even if MD already exists (full re-conversion)
- Validate and fix as normal

### Quick Critical-Only Check (Lax Mode)

```
User: "Run pdf-to-md quality gate for nist.pdf in lax mode"
```

AI will:

- Fix CRITICAL findings only
- Report HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW without fixing them
- Success when zero CRITICAL findings on 2 consecutive checks

### Custom Output Path

```
User: "Run pdf-to-md quality gate for /data/source.pdf with md-file=/docs/reference/source.md"
```

AI will:

- Generate Markdown at specified output path
- Validate against PDF source

### With Iteration Bounds

```
User: "Run pdf-to-md quality gate for nist.pdf in normal mode with min-iterations=2 and max-iterations=10"
```

## Iteration Example

```
Iteration 1:
  Maker: PDF → Markdown (847 pages, 23 tables, 45 figures, 12 Mermaid diagrams)
  Checker: 15 findings
    - CRITICAL: 3 missing sections (pages 234-241)
    - HIGH: 5 invalid Mermaid blocks
    - HIGH: 4 missing figure placeholders
    - MEDIUM: 3 heading hierarchy drifts
  Fixer: Applied 12 HIGH_CONFIDENCE fixes; skipped 3 MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE

Iteration 2:
  Re-validate (scoped to changed sections): 2 findings
    - HIGH: 1 Mermaid block still invalid after first fix attempt
    - MEDIUM: 1 heading drift in re-inserted section
  Fixer: Applied 1 fix; 1 MEDIUM skipped
  consecutive_zero_count: 0 (findings > 0 — reset)

Iteration 3:
  Re-validate (scoped): 0 findings
  consecutive_zero_count: 1 (first zero)

Iteration 4 (confirmation):
  Re-validate (scoped): 0 findings
  consecutive_zero_count: 2 ← double-zero confirmed

Result: PASS (4 iterations)
```

## Safety Features

**Infinite Loop Prevention**:

- max-iterations defaults to 7
- Escalation warning at iteration 5

**Convergence Safeguards**:

- Checker loads `generated-reports/.known-false-positives.md` at each iteration start
- Fixer persists new FALSE_POSITIVEs to that same file in `generated-reports/`
- Step 5 (Re-validate) uses changed-sections-only scan when called after Step 4 (Apply Fixes)

**False Positive Protection**:

- Fixer re-validates each finding before applying
- FALSE_POSITIVE findings skipped and logged
- Stable key format prevents duplicate skip list entries

**Graceful Degradation**:

- Missing `tesseract` → fail early with install instructions (image-only PDFs)
- Missing `pdftotext` → fail early with install instructions (all PDFs)
- Missing `mmdc` → Mermaid validation falls back to syntax-only inspection

**Manual Intervention Flags**:

- OCR quality disputes: flagged in fix report, not auto-applied
- Ambiguous diagram types: kept as `[FIGURE N: ...]` placeholder

## Tool Dependencies

Build crane-cli and add to PATH:

```bash
npx nx run crane-cli:build                           # builds apps/crane-cli/bin/Release/net10.0/crane
export PATH="$PWD/apps/crane-cli/bin/Release/net10.0:$PATH"
crane --version                                      # prints assembly version, exits 0
crane --help                                         # lists every subcommand
```

Install system dependencies:

```bash
brew install tesseract     # OCR for image-only PDFs
brew install jq            # JSON parsing for crane output
```

Verify:

```bash
crane --version
crane --help
tesseract --version
jq --version
```

**Aggregator entry point**: `crane check-all <pdf> <md>` runs the six core check dimensions in one
process with a single shared PDF extraction. Prefer this over invoking each dimension separately.
Add `--cache-dir <dir>` to persist PDF extractions keyed by SHA256 of the PDF bytes; subsequent
runs against the same PDF read the cached extraction instead of re-parsing. The cache is opt-in.

**Large-PDF fallback**: `crane check-all` may exceed practical completion time on documents larger
than ~200 pages (text-completeness is the dominant cost). When the aggregator times out or produces
empty output, the checker MAY fall back to per-dimension subcommands (`crane text`, `crane heading`,
`crane nesting`, `crane table`, `crane figure`, `crane mermaid`, `crane ocr`). If the fallback
samples rather than exhausts a dimension (e.g. text-completeness checked on a subset of pages), the
checker MUST disclose the sampling scope in the audit report's footer under a `## Workflow
Deviations` section so downstream readers know which dimensions have full coverage versus sampling
coverage.
