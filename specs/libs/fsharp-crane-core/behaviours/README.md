## Adapters

`fsharp-crane-core:test:unit` consumes this corpus through the TickSpec bindings under
`libs/fsharp-crane-core/tests/unit/`. `fsharp-crane-core:test:integration` owns the library's real
local-file/environment boundary; both routing scenarios are exempt at that layer because their
collaborator-selection evidence requires injected recording ports, with the exact Unit scenario
named as alternative proof. Static `test:coverage:unit`, `test:coverage:integration`,
`test:coverage:behaviour`, and aggregate `test:coverage` validate recursive corpus/binding closure
without executing tests. See the corpus [README](../README.md#adapter-and-targets) for boundary
rationale.
