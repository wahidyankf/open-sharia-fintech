## Adapters and Targets

The Unit adapter uses injected environment and filesystem doubles under
`libs/fsharp-env-loader/tests/unit/Behaviour/`; the Integration adapter under
`libs/fsharp-env-loader/tests/integration/Behaviour/` exercises isolated real local resources.
Run them with `fsharp-env-loader:test:unit` and `fsharp-env-loader:test:integration`. Static
`test:coverage:unit`, `test:coverage:integration`, `test:coverage:behaviour`, and aggregate
`test:coverage` validate corpus/binding closure without executing either adapter. E2E is omitted
because this library exposes no public browser, HTTP, or process boundary.
