Product-level specifications for wahidyankf-www — what the application is for, who uses it,

## What it is

`wahidyankf-www` is a personal portfolio and CV site for Wahidyan Kresna Fridayoka. It
serves two audiences: technical recruiters and hiring managers scanning a professional
profile, and collaborators looking for contact and project links. The site is read-only,
fully static (no backend, no auth, no database), and deploys from `prod-wahidyankf-www` to
Vercel at [www.wahidyankf.com](https://www.wahidyankf.com).
