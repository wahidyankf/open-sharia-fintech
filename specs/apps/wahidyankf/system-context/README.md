# wahidyankf-web — System Context (C4 L1)

Audience: Engineers, Technical Product/Project Managers

System-context specifications for wahidyankf-web — actors, external systems, and the
boundary of what this site builds vs what it depends on. This is C4 Level 1.

## Actors

| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Visitor | Any anonymous user who loads the portfolio site in a browser (no login) |

## External systems

| System       | Interaction                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vercel CDN   | Serves all static assets; handles HTTPS and edge caching |
| Google Fonts | Provides the Inter font loaded at build time             |
