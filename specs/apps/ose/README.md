# OSE

Specifications for the OSE product family. Two distinct products share this tree — the OSE
Application (`ose-app-web` + `ose-be`, the AI-assisted GRC platform at `app.oseplatform.com`) and
OSE Platform Web (`ose-www`, the marketing and updates site at `oseplatform.com`) — across three
logical owners.
