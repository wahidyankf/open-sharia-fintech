Feature: AI model benchmark tool

  Background:
    Given the AI benchmark dataset is loaded

  # AC-4
  @unit
  Scenario: A model reaching the opus anchor renders in the opus band
    Given a fixture model whose composite index equals the opus anchor index
    When the capability groups are computed
    Then that model belongs to the "opus" band

  # AC-5
  @unit
  Scenario: A model between the two anchors renders in the sonnet band
    Given a fixture model whose composite index is above the sonnet anchor index
    And that model's composite index is below the opus anchor index
    When the capability groups are computed
    Then that model belongs to the "sonnet" band

  # AC-6
  @unit
  Scenario: A model below the sonnet anchor renders in the light band
    Given a fixture model whose composite index is below the sonnet anchor index
    When the capability groups are computed
    Then that model belongs to the "light" band

  # AC-7
  @unit
  Scenario: Each anchor model occupies the band it defines
    Given the two anchor models are present in the roster
    When the capability groups are computed
    Then the opus anchor belongs to the "opus" band
    And the sonnet anchor belongs to the "sonnet" band

  # AC-8
  @unit
  Scenario: A model with no published benchmark score renders in the unrated group
    Given a fixture model with no score on any composite benchmark
    When the capability groups are computed
    Then that model belongs to the "unrated" group
    And that model has no composite index

  # AC-9
  @unit
  Scenario: Every roster model belongs to exactly one capability group
    Given the full roster is loaded
    When the capability groups are computed
    Then each model appears in exactly one of "opus", "sonnet", "light", or "unrated"

  # AC-10
  @unit
  Scenario: A model missing a benchmark is scored over the benchmarks it has
    Given a fixture model with a score on two of the four composite benchmarks
    When its composite index is computed
    Then the index equals the weight-renormalized mean of those two normalized scores
    And its coverage ratio equals the summed weight of those two benchmarks divided by one hundred

  # AC-11
  @unit
  Scenario: Models are ordered identically in both charts within a band
    Given the full roster is loaded
    When both charts are rendered
    Then each band lists its models in the same order in the capability chart and the price chart
