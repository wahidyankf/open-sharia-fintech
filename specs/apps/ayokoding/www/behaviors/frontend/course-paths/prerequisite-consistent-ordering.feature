Feature: Prerequisite-consistent ordering

  As a path-manifest author
  I want the prerequisite-consistency check to enforce ordering without forcing completeness
  So that a manifest can curate a subset of courses while still catching a genuine ordering mistake

  @wip
  Scenario: A path manifest is a valid topological entry into the prerequisite DAG
    Given a path manifest lists a courseOrder of course IDs
    When the prerequisite-consistency check runs
    Then no course appears before any of its declared prerequisites that are also in the manifest
    And the check reports zero ordering violations for that manifest

  @wip
  Scenario: A path may link a prerequisite it does not include, without failing integrity
    Given a path manifest includes a course whose declared prerequisite is absent from that manifest
    When the prerequisite-consistency check runs
    Then the absent prerequisite is not reported as a violation
    And the absent prerequisite appears in the check's informational linkedPrerequisites list
