# course-paths — ayokoding-www Gherkin Domain

Behaviour scenarios for the learning-path schema, prerequisite graph, and path-aware navigation
owned by `ayokoding-www`.

## Coverage Model

Every active scenario has substantive Unit proof in `apps/ayokoding-www/tests/unit/`. Browser-visible
scenarios also have Playwright proof in `apps/ayokoding-www-fe-e2e/tests/e2e/`; a scenario whose
concern cannot be observed through that public browser boundary carries its own canonical
`@e2e-exempt` comment and tag. The corpus uses no positive layer-selection tags and no `@wip`
deferral. Static `test:coverage:*` targets validate recursive corpus and adapter closure without
executing tests.

The former build-green scenario was retired because repository build status is a CI-meta concern,
not product behaviour. Manifest integrity and prerequisite ordering remain product rules and are
proved by pure Unit adapters over synthetic manifest data.
