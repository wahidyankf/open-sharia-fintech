  @integration-exempt
  Scenario: Cost-of-living breakdown lists category expenses per city
    Given I am on "/en/tools/cost-of-living-calculator"
    And the "Cost of living" tab is active
    When the page finishes loading
    Then I see a table of tech-hub cities
    And each row shows a Country column immediately to the left of the City column
    And each row shows monthly housing, food, transport, utilities, healthcare, childcare, school, and lifestyle expenses
    And each row shows an essentials subtotal and a total
    And each row shows a separate one-time relocation sunk-cost total
    And each row shows a separately labelled liquidity reserve

  @integration-exempt
  Scenario: Region narrows the country filter and country narrows the city filter
    Given I am on "/en/tools/cost-of-living-calculator"
    And the "Cost of living" tab is active
    When I select the region "ASEAN" then the country "Indonesia" in the cascading filters
    Then the Country filter lists only ASEAN countries
    And the City filter lists only Indonesian cities
    And only cities in Indonesia are shown in the table

    Given I am on "/en/tools/cost-of-living-calculator"
    When I click a city name in any table
    Then I am taken to that city's single-city Cost-of-living detail at "?city=<id>"

    And I switch to the "Minimum role" tab
    And I set the baseline source to "savings target"
    When I enter a monthly savings target of "8000" USD

    And the lowest role rank that reaches at least 8000 USD essential savings anywhere in the filter is marked as the minimum
    And (city, role) rows that cannot reach 8000 USD essential savings are shown below the divider and de-emphasised

  # The reported "only one Malaysia entry / results hidden" bug. Each (city, role) is its own
  # candidate row — there is NO per-role argmax that keeps only one "best" city per role — so every

    And the bar is not raised to a cheaper city's optimum that I do not live in
    And the ladder marks the lowest role that meets or beats it

  Scenario: The Savings gross-salary field shows the active currency as a separate indicator
    Given I am on the "Savings" tab
    When the gross-salary field renders
    Then the gross-salary label does not contain the literal currency code "USD"
    And an active-currency indicator next to the field shows "USD"

    Given I am on the "Minimum role" tab with the savings-target baseline and a blank target
    When the tab renders
