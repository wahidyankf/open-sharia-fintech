# ose-www-be-e2e

Dedicated Playwright adapter for OSE website server behaviours observed through the deployed public
HTTP boundary.

## BDD and Testing

This project consumes `specs/apps/ose/www/behaviours/backend/`; it owns no independent corpus.
`test:e2e` runs the public-boundary adapter, while `test:coverage:e2e`,
`test:coverage:behaviour`, and aggregate `test:coverage` validate it statically. Unit and
Integration targets are omitted because those layers belong to the owner application and a
dedicated E2E project owns neither in-process decision logic nor a non-networked local-resource
boundary.

Run `npm exec nx -- run ose-www-be-e2e:test:quick` for static checks or
`npm exec nx -- run ose-www-be-e2e:test:e2e` for the complete runtime suite.
