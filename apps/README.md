# Applications

`apps/` contains the products, services, command-line tools, and end-to-end test projects that can be built and run from this workspace. Start with the product or capability you need; each app README has its local requirements and commands.

## End-to-end tests

End-to-end projects keep browser and API behavior separate from the application they exercise. Use the app README for prerequisites, then run the matching project's `test:e2e` target.

## Work with an app

Run Nx targets from the workspace root. Replace `ose-www` with the project you chose above:

```bash
npm exec nx -- dev ose-www
npm exec nx -- run ose-www:test:quick
npm exec nx -- build ose-www
```

Each project declares its available targets in `project.json`. Use `npm exec nx -- show project <project-name>` to inspect them, and follow the app README for app-specific setup.

## Structure and boundaries

Apps are independently runnable projects. They can use shared code from [`libs/`](../libs/README.md), but they do not import one another. App names make their role clear:

- `[domain]-www` is a public website.
- `[domain]-app-web` is a product web client.
- `[domain]-app` is an approved future-multiplatform product client (none in this workspace today).
- `[domain]-be` is a product backend.
- `*-e2e` is an end-to-end test project for a named surface.

For the workspace-wide structure and standard targets, see the [monorepo structure reference](../docs/reference/monorepo-structure.md) and [Nx targets reference](../repo-governance/development/infra/nx-targets.md). To create a new app, follow [Add a new app](../docs/how-to/add-new-app.md).
