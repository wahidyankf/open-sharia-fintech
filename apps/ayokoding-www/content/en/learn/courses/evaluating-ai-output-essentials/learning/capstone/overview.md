## The capstone: the complete light eval gate

The capstone builds the smallest honest eval gate for a feature the learner already has working
from `creating-ai-powered-apps` -- a versioned dataset, a registry of deterministic scorers, a
runner that executes each case twice and reports a pass rate alongside tokens/cost/latency, and a
comparison report that diffs a candidate run against a stored baseline -- then uses it to accept
one real prompt change and reject another. Every script lives under `learning/capstone/code/`,
fully type-annotated (DD-39), and was actually run against **Python 3.13** to capture the output
shown below. Unlike every other worked example in this topic, the four capstone files import from
one another as a single small project -- this is this topic's one deliberate exception to the
"no cross-example imports" rule.

- **Step 1 -- `dataset.jsonl`**: fourteen real cases, each with a written criterion and a declared
  scorer. Ties together co-02, co-03, co-04.
- **Step 2 -- `scorers.py`**: the five-scorer registry, plus one deliberately over-permissive
  scorer and its tightened fix. Ties together co-02, co-05, co-06.
- **Step 3 -- `runner.py`**: executes every case twice, applies the mapped scorer, and commits a
  reproducible results artefact. Ties together co-01, co-07, co-08, co-11.
- **Step 4 -- `compare.py`**: diffs a candidate run against the committed baseline and accepts or
  rejects on regressions -- never on pass rate alone. Ties together co-07, co-09.

**Concepts exercised**: [x] a written, two-person-stable criterion (co-02) [x] a fixed versioned
dataset (co-03, co-04) [x] deterministic + schema scorers (co-05, co-06) [x] pass rate as the
headline (co-07) [x] repeat runs and flake handling (co-08) [x] baseline-vs-candidate comparison
(co-09) [x] a regression case sourced from a real failure (co-10) [x] cost and latency recorded in
the same run (co-11).

## Step 1: dataset.jsonl -- the versioned, written-criteria dataset

**Context**: Theme A (Examples 5, 10) taught the shape of a single dataset case and its minimal
schema. This step commits the capstone's own fourteen-case dataset -- one line per case, each with
an `id`, the question `input`, the `expected` answer, the `scorer` this case is mapped to by name,
and a written `criterion` a second reader could apply and reach the same verdict. Case `case-13` is
a regression case sourced from a real bug report (co-10, mirrored by Theme D's ex-39); case `case-14`
is the one structured-output case, scored by schema validation rather than text matching.

```jsonl
# learning/capstone/code/dataset.jsonl
{"id": "case-01", "fact_id": "storage-free", "input": "How much free storage does a new Nimbus account get?", "expected": "15 GB", "scorer": "regex", "criterion": "answer must mention 15 GB"}
{"id": "case-02", "fact_id": "storage-pro", "input": "How much storage does Nimbus Pro include?", "expected": "200 GB", "scorer": "regex", "criterion": "answer must mention 200 GB"}
{"id": "case-03", "fact_id": "security-2fa", "input": "Does Nimbus support two-factor authentication?", "expected": "two-factor", "scorer": "regex", "criterion": "answer must mention two-factor authentication"}
{"id": "case-04", "fact_id": "platforms", "input": "Which mobile platform does the Nimbus app ship on first?", "expected": "iOS", "scorer": "regex", "criterion": "answer must name iOS"}
{"id": "case-05", "fact_id": "file-size-free", "input": "What is the largest single file the Free plan accepts, in GB?", "expected": "5", "scorer": "numeric_tolerance", "criterion": "answer must state 5 GB, within 0 GB tolerance"}
{"id": "case-06", "fact_id": "file-size-pro", "input": "What is the largest single file the Pro plan accepts, in GB?", "expected": "50", "scorer": "numeric_tolerance", "criterion": "answer must state 50 GB, within 0 GB tolerance"}
{"id": "case-07", "fact_id": "share-link-expiry", "input": "After how many days does a default Nimbus share link expire?", "expected": "30", "scorer": "numeric_tolerance", "criterion": "answer must state 30 days, within 0 day tolerance"}
{"id": "case-08", "fact_id": "support-response", "input": "What is the first-response time target for Free-plan email support?", "expected": "24-hour", "scorer": "regex", "criterion": "answer must match a 24-hour first-response pattern"}
{"id": "case-09", "fact_id": "trash-retention", "input": "How many days does Nimbus keep a deleted file in trash?", "expected": "30", "scorer": "numeric_tolerance", "criterion": "answer must state 30 days, within 0 day tolerance"}
{"id": "case-10", "fact_id": "offline-sync", "input": "Which plan supports offline sync, Free or Pro?", "expected": "pro only", "scorer": "exact_match", "criterion": "answer must equal 'pro only' exactly, character for character"}
{"id": "case-11", "fact_id": "api-access", "input": "Which plan includes access to the public REST API?", "expected": "Pro", "scorer": "regex", "criterion": "answer must name the Pro plan"}
{"id": "case-12", "fact_id": "encryption", "input": "What encryption does Nimbus use for files at rest?", "expected": "AES-256", "scorer": "regex", "criterion": "answer must match the AES-256 pattern"}
{"id": "case-13", "fact_id": "external-sharing", "input": "Can I share a Nimbus file with someone outside my team?", "expected": "yes, via a share link", "scorer": "normalized_match", "criterion": "normalized answer must equal 'yes, via a share link' -- sourced from a real bug report (ex-39)"}
{"id": "case-14", "fact_id": "account-status-schema", "input": "Return the current account status as structured JSON.", "expected": "schema:status,storage_used_gb,plan", "scorer": "schema", "criterion": "structured output must include status (str), storage_used_gb (float), and plan (str)"}
```

**Acceptance criteria**: every one of the fourteen lines parses as valid JSON with the four required
keys (`id`, `input`, `expected`, `scorer`), matching the schema Example 10 validated (co-03, co-04).
Every case's `criterion` is written specifically enough that a second reader, given only the
`criterion` text and the model's answer, would reach the same pass/fail verdict as the declared
`scorer` (co-02) -- for example, `case-01`'s criterion ("answer must mention 15 GB") and its `regex`
scorer both accept only an answer containing the literal figure, with no room for two readers to
disagree. `case-13` traces to a real reported failure (co-10), not a speculative addition.

**Key takeaway**: fourteen cases -- comfortably inside the ten-to-twenty-case range this course's
capstone spec calls for -- is enough to exercise every scorer type this topic teaches (exact match,
normalized match, regex, numeric tolerance, and schema), while staying small enough that a human can
read the whole dataset in under a minute.

**Why It Matters**: a dataset that is both versioned (plain JSONL, diffable in a code review) and
individually criterion-justified (co-02) is what turns "we have some example inputs" into "we have
an eval" -- the criteria are what let a reviewer trust the scorer mapping without re-deriving each
verdict by hand. Skipping the written criterion step is how a dataset quietly becomes fourteen
inputs nobody can independently re-check, no better than the vibe check this whole course exists to
replace.

## Step 2: scorers.py -- the five-scorer registry

**Context**: Theme B (Examples 11-20) built each deterministic scorer in isolation. This step
packages all five into one importable registry, plus the deliberately over-permissive
`loose_fact_scorer` Example 20 warned against, run here directly against its own fix to prove the
tightened `regex` scorer actually catches what the loose one misses.

```python

    passed = normalized_output == expected.strip().lower()  # => co-05: both sides normalized identically

def regex(output: object, expected: str) -> Verdict:  # => co-05: registry entry "regex" -- expected doubles as the pattern text

    output_map = cast(dict[str, object], output)  # => co-06: bare-dict narrowing gives dict[Unknown, Unknown] -- cast restores a checkable value type

        if key not in output_map:  # => co-06: a field is simply absent
            return Verdict(False, f"missing field: {key}")  # => co-06: a reason naming the exact missing field

    return Verdict(passed, "contains a digit" if passed else "contains no digit at all")  # => co-02


SCORER_REGISTRY: dict[str, Callable[..., Verdict]] = {  # => co-05: name -> function, ONE lookup table for every case
    "exact_match": exact_match,  # => co-05: entry 1
    "normalized_match": normalized_match,  # => co-05: entry 2
    "regex": regex,  # => co-05: entries 1-3
    "numeric_tolerance": numeric_tolerance,  # => co-05: entry 4
    "schema": schema,  # => co-05: entries 4-5
}  # => co-05: closes SCORER_REGISTRY -- exactly the five scorer types this capstone step builds


if __name__ == "__main__":  # => co-05: entry point -- runs only when this file executes directly, not on import
    loose_verdict = loose_fact_scorer("Nimbus Pro includes 20 GB.", "200 GB")  # => co-02: the wrong figure, scored by the loose scorer
    tight_verdict = regex("Nimbus Pro includes 20 GB.", "200 GB")  # => co-02: the SAME wrong output, scored by the tightened regex scorer
    print(f"Loose scorer on a WRONG answer: {loose_verdict}")  # => co-02: prints the false pass
    print(f"Tightened scorer on the SAME wrong answer: {tight_verdict}")  # => co-02: prints the corrected fail
    assert loose_verdict.passed is True, "the loose scorer must wrongly pass a factually wrong answer"  # => co-02: proves the lie
    assert tight_verdict.passed is False, "the tightened regex scorer must catch the same wrong answer"  # => co-02: confirms the fix
    for name, fn in SCORER_REGISTRY.items():  # => co-05: a quick self-check that every registered scorer is callable
        assert callable(fn), f"registry entry {name!r} must be callable"  # => co-05: sanity check
    print(f"MATCH: {len(SCORER_REGISTRY)} deterministic scorers registered, each returning (passed, reason)")  # => co-05
    # => co-05: runner.py imports SCORER_REGISTRY directly -- no case ever routes through the loose scorer above
```

**Run**: `python3 scorers.py`

**Output**:

```text
Loose scorer on a WRONG answer: Verdict(passed=True, reason='contains a digit')
Tightened scorer on the SAME wrong answer: Verdict(passed=False, reason="pattern '200 GB' not found in 'Nimbus Pro includes 20 GB.'")
MATCH: 5 deterministic scorers registered, each returning (passed, reason)
```

**Acceptance criteria**: every registered scorer's pass and fail path is verified (co-05), including
`schema`'s missing-field and wrong-type rejections. The deliberately over-permissive
`loose_fact_scorer` must wrongly pass a factually wrong answer (`"Nimbus Pro includes 20 GB."` when
the expected figure is `200 GB`), and the tightened `regex` scorer must catch that exact same wrong
output (co-02). Both hold, verified by the asserts inside the script and matching the captured
output above.

**Key takeaway**: packaging every scorer behind one name-keyed registry means `runner.py` never
needs to know which scorer function a case uses -- only its `scorer` string -- and the loose-vs-
tightened comparison proves, with a real before/after run, why a scorer's own contract matters as
much as the criterion it's checking.

**Why It Matters**: a scorer that wrongly passes wrong output is worse than no eval at all -- it
manufactures false confidence. Running the loose and tightened scorers side by side against the
identical wrong output is the cheapest possible demonstration that a scorer's precision is not
optional. A team that skips this side-by-side check has no way to know whether their own scorer is
quietly as loose as `loose_fact_scorer`, right up until it wrongly passes a genuinely broken
feature.

## Step 3: runner.py -- the two-trial runner

**Context**: Theme C (Examples 23-34) built the runner's pieces separately -- the minimal end-to-end
loop, the pass-rate reduction, run-it-twice flake detection, and cost/latency capture. This step
combines all of them into one script that runs the capstone's own fourteen-case dataset twice
against a mocked "prompt v1" system, then commits the result as a reproducible artefact.

```python
# learning/capstone/code/runner.py
"""Capstone step 3: the two-trial runner (exercises co-01, co-07, co-08, co-11)."""  # => co-07: this file's own restated purpose, doubling as its module __doc__

import statistics  # => co-11: p95 needs nothing beyond the standard library's own statistics module

    # => co-01,co-03,co-05,co-07,co-08,co-09,co-11: dataset, scorer, and two-trial run, all tied together in one artefact
```

**Run**: `python3 runner.py`

**Output**:

```text
Pass rate: 85.71% | Flaky cases: ['case-08']
Tokens: 613 | Cost: $0.001226 | p95 latency: 581.5ms
MATCH: results written to results_baseline.json, flaky case correctly identified across two trials
```

**Acceptance criteria**: the run reports a pass rate (`85.71%`, twelve of fourteen cases passing on
trial 1) alongside token, cost, and p95-latency figures in the same artefact (co-11). Case `case-08`
-- the one case whose mocked answer genuinely varies by trial -- must be the only case flagged flaky
(co-08). Writing the same in-memory `results` dict to disk must produce byte-identical JSON, verified
by the script's own reproducibility assert (co-09). All hold, matching the captured output above.

**Key takeaway**: running twice and diffing per-case verdicts (not just re-running once and hoping)
is what catches `case-08`'s flakiness -- a single-trial run would have reported the same `85.71%`
pass rate with no hint that one of the twelve "passing" cases only passed by chance of which trial
happened to run.

**Why It Matters**: `results_baseline.json` is this capstone's single source of truth for "did the
system's output quality change" -- every later comparison (Step 4, and Theme D's own baseline/
candidate examples) reads from this exact committed file rather than re-deriving the baseline from
scratch, which is exactly what makes a comparison trustworthy instead of ad hoc.

---

## Step 4: compare.py -- accept or reject on regressions, never on pass rate alone

**Context**: Theme D (Examples 35-38) built the diff-and-decide pattern against small, standalone
fixtures. This step applies the same decision rule to the capstone's own committed baseline: two
candidate prompts are compared against `results_baseline.json`, one that genuinely improves on
every case, and one that raises the raw pass rate while quietly breaking a previously-passing case.

```python

```

**Run**: `python3 compare.py`

**Output**:

```text
Candidate v2: 100.00% (baseline 85.71%) -> ACCEPT -- 2 win(s), 0 regressions
Candidate v3: 92.86% (baseline 85.71%) -> REJECT -- 1 regression(s): ['case-01']
MATCH: v2 is accepted, v3 is rejected -- even though v3's pass rate alone looks better than the baseline
```

**Acceptance criteria**: candidate v2 (14/14, `100.00%`) must be accepted, having fixed both known
baseline failures (`case-08`, `case-13`) with zero regressions. Candidate v3 (13/14, `92.86%`) -- a
strictly higher raw pass rate than the `85.71%` baseline -- must be rejected because it breaks
`case-01`, a case the baseline previously passed (co-09, co-07). Both hold, matching the captured
output and the script's own asserts.

**Key takeaway**: the whole capstone converges on one sentence: a candidate is judged by whether it
introduces any regression against the committed baseline, never by whether its raw pass rate is
numerically higher -- exactly the trap Theme D's ex-38 demonstrated in isolation, now proven against
this capstone's own real, committed baseline artefact.

**Why It Matters**: this is the decision rule that makes the entire gate worth building. Without it,
a team ships candidate v3 because "92.86% beats 85.71%" and only discovers the `case-01` regression
from a user report -- exactly the failure mode co-10 turns into the next permanent dataset case, and
exactly the reason this course insists on a per-case diff, not a headline number, as the actual
merge gate.
