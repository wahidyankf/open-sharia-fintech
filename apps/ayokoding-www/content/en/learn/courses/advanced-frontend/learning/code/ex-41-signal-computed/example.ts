// Example 41: A Computed Signal Tracks Its Dependencies. (co-22)
//
// A computed signal derives its value from other signals. It tracks which signals it read and
// recomputes ONLY when one of those dependencies changes -- not on every signal change anywhere.
//
// > **Accuracy note**: "computed signals track which signals are accessed and re-run ... when those
// > signals change." Source: Preact Signals (https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/).
