// Example 42: A Signal Updates the DOM Without a Parent Re-render. (co-22)
//
// The fine-grained payoff: when a signal changes, only the effect that read it re-runs (updating
// just the bound DOM text). The parent COMPONENT does not re-render at all -- unlike React, where a
// state change re-runs the whole component function. This is the core performance claim of
// signal-based frameworks (SolidJS, Preact Signals).
//
// > **Accuracy note**: SolidJS "compiles its templates to real DOM nodes ... only the code that
// > depends on it will rerun" (solidjs/solid README, fetched). Verbatim `docs.solidjs.com` quotes
// > remain `[Unverified]` (the docs site was Cloudflare-blocked, 403, on re-check).

let parentRenders = 0; // => counts how many times the PARENT component function ran
// => parentRenders staying flat while the bound DOM updates is the fine-grained payoff
