// INP REPLACED FID as a stable Core Web Vital on March 12, 2024 -- this table is the current
// (2026) triad, not the older LCP/FID/CLS set. All thresholds are at the 75th percentile over a
// rolling 28-day CrUX window.
//
// > **Accuracy note**: INP replaced FID on March 12, 2024
// > (https://web.dev/blog/inp-cwv-launch). LCP/INP/CLS thresholds from web.dev (fetched, verbatim).
