This series builds a working Scheme interpreter from scratch using Go. The goal is not to write idiomatic Go — it is to understand how programming languages work from the inside.

By the end, you will have implemented every layer of a real interpreter: a tokenizer, a recursive descent parser, an environment-based evaluator, first-class closures, and tail-call optimization. Each part isolates one CS concept so you can study it cleanly before the next one builds on it.

## Why Lisp for Interpreter Theory

Lisp is the canonical vehicle for interpreter pedagogy because its syntax removes almost all accidental complexity. There is no operator precedence to resolve, no statement/expression distinction, no special syntactic forms that require bespoke parsing rules. The entire language is made of one recursive structure: the S-expression.

```scheme
(+ 1 2)               ; a list: operator + two operands
(define x 10)         ; a list: keyword + name + value
(lambda (x) (* x x))  ; a list: keyword + param list + body
```

This uniformity — code and data sharing the same structure — is called **homoiconicity**. It is what makes Lisp interpreters short and pedagogically transparent: the interpreter's internal representation of a program is visible as ordinary data.

## What We Build: A Scheme Dialect

We implement a subset of **Scheme** (R5RS), not Common Lisp or a custom language. Scheme is the near-universal pedagogical choice because it is minimal, formally specified, and mandates properties (tail-call optimization, lexical scope) that force us to implement CS concepts correctly rather than approximately.

**Core forms implemented:**

| Form     | What it does                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `define` | Bind a name to a value in the current environment                   |
| `if`     | Conditional: evaluate test, branch to consequent or alternate       |
| `lambda` | Create a closure: a function that captures its defining environment |
| `begin`  | Sequence expressions; return the last value                         |
| `quote`  | Return a form unevaluated                                           |
| `let`    | Derived — syntactic sugar for `lambda` application                  |
| `cond`   | Derived — syntactic sugar for nested `if`                           |

**Excluded from scope:** `call/cc` (continuations), `define-syntax` (hygienic macros), garbage collection (delegated to Go runtime), the full R5RS standard library.

## Why Go

Go is a pedagogically interesting choice for implementing a Lisp interpreter — and not the obvious one:

- **Explicit over implicit**: Go's design philosophy is that nothing is hidden. Every operation is visible in the source. This aligns perfectly with what an interpreter teaches: you see every phase, every allocation, every lookup.
- **Interfaces + type switch**: Go's `interface` with a marker method is a workable representation for a heterogeneous value type. The `switch v := expr.(type)` dispatch maps naturally to the interpreter's evaluation logic — the same concept F# solves with discriminated unions and pattern matching.
- **Explicit error handling**: Every `eval` and `parse` call returns an `error`. This is more verbose than F# exceptions, but it mirrors what production interpreters do: errors are values, not exceptions.
- **No magic**: Go has no native tail-call optimization, no automatic pattern match exhaustiveness checks, no implicit functional operations. This is pedagogically valuable — everything we implement is visible. In F#, the discriminated union gives exhaustiveness checks for free; in Go, we must enforce it ourselves.
- **Simple standard library**: `bufio`, `fmt`, `strings`, `strconv` — sufficient for a complete interpreter with no external dependencies.

The contrast with the [F# version](/en/learn/software-engineering/compilers-and-interpreters/lisp-interpreter-in-fsharp) is instructive: F# gives you discriminated unions and pattern matching as built-in tools; Go makes you build equivalent mechanisms from interfaces and type switches. The CS concepts are identical — the implementation surface is different.
