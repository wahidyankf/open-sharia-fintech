**Want to master Finite State Machines through the lens of Functional Programming?** This by-example guide teaches FSM in four functional languages — F# (canonical), Clojure, TypeScript, and Haskell — through annotated code and diagram examples organized by complexity level, using a shared Procure-to-Pay (P2P) domain so every example builds on the same problem. Each example presents all four languages as parallel tabs; F# carries the deepest annotations and the framing prose, while Clojure, TypeScript, and Haskell are first-class variants.

## Why FP for FSMs?

FSMs fit Functional Programming naturally. A state machine is a function `State -> Event -> State` — a pure transition function. All four languages in this tutorial express this naturally: F# uses discriminated unions and pattern matching; Clojure uses keyword enums and multimethods; TypeScript uses union types and `switch` exhaustiveness checks; Haskell uses sum-type ADTs and `case` expressions. The OOP approach uses a class per state with virtual dispatch; the FP approach collapses that into a single `transition` function with a `match` / `multimethod` / `switch` / `case` expression in whichever language you choose. The FP version is shorter, testable in isolation, and impossible to put in an invalid state when the state type is sealed.

## Rust as an FP-Adjacent Member — With Concept Adjustments

Rust shares deep DNA with the FP languages on this track: `enum` is a sum type (Blandy & Orendorff, _Programming Rust_, Ch. 10), `match` is exhaustive pattern matching, and `Result<T, E>` is the Railway-Oriented Programming primitive natively. FSM idioms that translate one-to-one — states as `enum` variants, the pure `State -> Event -> Result<NextState, Error>` transition function, guard conditions as `match` arms returning `Err(...)` — appear without adjustment. But Rust adds **one capability the FP languages on this track do not have**: typestate-encoded state machines via ownership.

**Six concept adjustments when you read this FSM-in-FP track through a Rust lens:**

1. **Ownership turns illegal state transitions into compile errors.** In F#, the pure transition function `submit : Draft -> Result<AwaitingApproval, Error>` returns a new value; the caller _can_ still hold the old `Draft` (it stays in scope). In Rust, `fn submit(self) -> Result<AwaitingApproval, Error>` **moves** the `Draft` — the caller cannot use the old state because it has been consumed. The compile-time guarantee is strictly stronger. (Source: [Pretty State Machine Patterns in Rust — Hoverbear](https://hoverbear.org/blog/rust-state-machine-pattern/) | [Type-Driven API Design in Rust — Will Crichton](https://willcrichton.net/rust-api-type-patterns/typestate.html))
2. **Typestate as a fundamentally Rust-only pattern.** Each state is a **distinct struct type**, not a variant of one `enum`. `Draft`, `Submitted`, `Approved`, `Issued`, `Cancelled` are five separate types; transitions are functions between them; the type system enforces the legal transition graph without runtime checks. F# / Haskell GADT-style equivalents exist but are more verbose and less ergonomic. This is the canonical Rust FSM idiom and lives in the [in-procedural-by-example](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/finite-state-machine-fsm/in-procedural-by-example) track.
3. **No higher-kinded types (HKT).** Generic transition functions that abstract over the effect (`async`, `Result`, both) need HKT in F#/Haskell, which Rust lacks. Effect-polymorphic FSM runners require ad-hoc combinators, not generic monadic abstraction. (Source: [GAT stabilisation — Matsakis & Huey](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/10/28/gats-stabilization/))
4. **`?` operator for guarded transitions.** F# `Result.bind` chains the guard pipeline; Rust uses `?` to short-circuit the transition function on guard failure. (Source: [Rust By Example — `?` operator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std/result/question_mark.html))
5. **`async` / `Future` is not a monad.** Async state machine runners in F# use `async { }`; in Rust they use `async fn` with explicit `Future` futures. There is no monadic abstraction over both `Async` and `Result` — `tokio` provides ad-hoc combinators.
6. **No persistent FSM history by default.** F# lists/maps share via GC, so keeping an event log (`State list`) of every prior transition is cheap. Rust requires `Vec<Event>` (owned), `Arc<[Event]>` (shared immutable), or the `im` crate for persistent vectors.

Where the `enum`-based FSM idiom translates cleanly, Rust appears as an additional language tab alongside F# / Clojure / TypeScript / Haskell. Where typestate is the design force, the example links to the procedural track for the full Rust-canonical treatment.

## Domain Context

All examples model the `procurement-platform-be` backend. Employees request goods, managers approve, suppliers fulfill, and finance pays. This single domain thread — rather than a new toy problem per example — lets you compare FSM patterns across levels without re-learning the context.

## Learning Path

Three progressive levels, each adding a new aggregate:

- **Beginner** — `PurchaseOrder` state machine: F# discriminated unions as state sets, `State -> Event -> State` pure transition functions, guard conditions with `Result`, exhaustive `match` expressions, invalid-transition rejection.
- **Intermediate** — adds `Invoice` state machine: three-way match guards, state-entry/exit side-effects modelled as returned command lists, FSM composition, parallel machine coordination.
- **Advanced** — adds `Supplier` lifecycle and `Payment` state machine: hierarchical states via nested DUs, parallel regions, history states, FSM persistence and event-sourcing intersection, saga coordination in F#.
