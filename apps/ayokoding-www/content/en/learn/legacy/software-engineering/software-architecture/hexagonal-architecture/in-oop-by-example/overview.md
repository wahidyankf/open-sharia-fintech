**Want to apply Hexagonal Architecture with modern OOP languages?** This tutorial teaches the Ports and Adapters pattern through 75 heavily annotated examples in Java 21+, Kotlin, C#, and TypeScript.

## What This Tutorial Is

This tutorial presents 75 examples showing hexagonal architecture concepts implemented in Java 21+, Kotlin, C#, and TypeScript. Every example is self-contained, runnable, and annotated with `// =>` markers that show values, states, and effects at each step. Java is the canonical language carrying the deepest annotations; Kotlin, C#, and TypeScript variants appear where language-idiomatic differences matter to the hexagonal pattern. Examples build progressively from three-zone structure through advanced multi-context patterns.

Each example demonstrates a focused hexagonal concept. Examples build progressively: the three-zone structure and basic port/adapter separation appear first, application service orchestration and infrastructure adapters follow, and strategic multi-context patterns close the tutorial. Every example follows a consistent five-part structure (see below).

## Prerequisites

- Comfortable with at least one of Java, Kotlin, C#, or TypeScript at an intermediate level (whichever language you ship with)
- Familiar with OOP fundamentals: classes, interfaces, inheritance, and composition
- Has read the paradigm-agnostic overview at [Hexagonal Architecture Overview](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/hexagonal-architecture/overview)

## How to Read This Tutorial

This tutorial is code-first. Each example leads with working, self-contained code annotated with `// =>` markers that show values, types, zones, and effects at each step. Java examples are canonical; Kotlin, C#, and TypeScript tabs appear alongside where the idiom differs meaningfully.

The running domain across all examples is **procurement-platform-be** — a Procure-to-Pay (P2P) platform where employees request goods and services, managers approve, suppliers fulfill, and finance pays. The same domain is used in the [DDD OOP tutorial](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/domain-driven-design-ddd/in-oop-by-example/overview), letting you see how hexagonal boundaries fit around DDD building blocks.

## What This Tutorial Covers

**Core structural patterns**:

- The three-zone model — domain core, application layer, adapters
- Input ports (driving ports) — use case interfaces called by adapters
- Output ports (driven ports) — repository, notification, and service interfaces called by the application
- Primary adapters — HTTP controllers, CLI handlers, message consumers
- Secondary adapters — database repositories, email senders, external API clients
- In-memory adapters — fast, deterministic implementations for tests
- Dependency injection wiring — Spring `@Configuration` (Java/Kotlin), `Program.cs` DI (C#), NestJS `Module` (TypeScript), and manual constructor injection

**Intermediate patterns**:

- CQRS with separate command/query ports
- Domain events and event publishing ports (`EventPublisher`)
- Clock, approval-router, and configuration ports
- Retry, circuit-breaker, and idempotency in adapters
- Multiple bounded contexts as separate hexagons (`purchasing` + `supplier`)
- Anti-Corruption Layer adapters between contexts

**Advanced patterns**:

- Bounded context maps — hexagon relationships across `receiving`, `invoicing`, and `payments`
- `BankingPort` and retry-decorator adapter
- `SupplierNotifierPort` with SMTP/EDI fallback
- Observability adapters (OpenTelemetry via `Observability` port)
- Domain evolution — adding a new port without breaking the domain
- Adapter replacement without touching the domain

## What This Tutorial Does NOT Cover

- Language tutorials: Java, Kotlin, C#, and TypeScript each have their own by-example tutorials for language fundamentals
- DDD tactical patterns in depth: read the [DDD OOP tutorial](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/domain-driven-design-ddd/in-oop-by-example/overview) for entities, aggregates, value objects, and domain services
- Framework setup and project bootstrapping (Spring Boot initialisation, Gradle/Maven configuration)
- Kubernetes, Docker, or deployment infrastructure

## Sibling Tutorial: Functional Programming Approach

If you prefer a functional programming treatment of Hexagonal Architecture, see [Hexagonal Architecture By Example in FP](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/hexagonal-architecture/in-fp-by-example/overview). That tutorial covers the same patterns through F# function type aliases, partial application, and Railway-Oriented Programming pipelines, using the same procurement-platform-be domain.

## Where Go Fits (Strong)

Hexagonal Architecture is the **strongest fit for Go** of any track on this site. Alistair Cockburn's [original definition](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture) is explicitly language-agnostic — ports are interfaces, adapters are implementations. Go's **implicit interface satisfaction (structural typing)** is arguably a _better_ fit than Java's explicit `implements` because adding a new adapter requires only satisfying the method set, with no declaration coupling to the port. Canonical references: Matías Varela — [Hexagonal Architecture in Go](https://medium.com/@matiasvarela/hexagonal-architecture-in-go-cfd4e436faa3); [Three Dots Labs](https://threedots.tech/post/ddd-cqrs-clean-architecture-combined/) DDD + CQRS + Clean Architecture in Go reference implementation; Matthew Boyle, [_Domain-Driven Design with Golang_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/domain-driven-design-with/9781804613450/) (Packt, 2022).

What Go _does_ for hexagonal:

- **Output ports as one-method interfaces** — Go's "interface segregation by default" convention naturally produces the small, focused port interfaces hexagonal demands.
- **Adapters as concrete struct implementations** — no `@Component` annotation needed; the struct simply has matching method signatures.
- **Composition root in `main.go`** — explicit constructor wiring rather than a Spring `@Configuration` reflection container; the wiring is plain code, readable and step-debuggable.
- **In-memory test adapter is trivial** — a struct holding a `map[ID]Entity`; no mocking framework.

That makes Go a **first-class hexagonal language**. However, the OOP track teaches patterns that depend on Java/C#/Kotlin features (`@Configuration`-driven DI, Spring `@Profile` conditional wiring, `@Autowired` constructor injection, sealed types for domain errors). For the Go-canonical formulation — manual constructor wiring, `interface` ports, struct adapters — see [in-procedural-by-example](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/hexagonal-architecture/in-procedural-by-example).

## Structure of Each Example

Every example follows a consistent five-part format:

1. **Brief Explanation**: What hexagonal concept the example demonstrates (2–3 sentences).
2. **Optional Diagram**: A Mermaid diagram when concept relationships are complex enough to warrant visual representation. Skipped for straightforward code definitions.
3. **Code Block(s)**: Java 21+ implementation(s) with `// =>` annotations explaining values, states, zones, and effects. Multi-block examples separate distinct approaches with explanatory text between blocks.
4. **Key Takeaway**: The core hexagonal principle to retain (1–2 sentences).
5. **Why It Matters**: Real-world business and production system impact (50–100 words).
