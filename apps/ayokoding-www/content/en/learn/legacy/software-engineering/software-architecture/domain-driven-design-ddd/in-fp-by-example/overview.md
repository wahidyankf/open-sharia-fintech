**Want to model complex business domains so that illegal states are literally unrepresentable at compile time?** This tutorial teaches Domain-Driven Design through a functional programming lens, using four languages — F# (canonical), Clojure, TypeScript, and Haskell — and the backend of a Procure-to-Pay (P2P) procurement platform as the running domain. Each example presents all four languages as parallel tabs; F# carries the deepest annotations and the framing prose, while Clojure, TypeScript, and Haskell are first-class variants that show the same domain patterns in their respective idioms.

## What This Tutorial Covers

This tutorial explores three interlocking ideas that make functional programming an unusually powerful DDD tool. Each idea is shown in F# (canonical), Clojure, TypeScript, and Haskell:

**Type-driven design** — F# discriminated unions and record types, Clojure spec-validated maps, TypeScript union types + Zod schemas, and Haskell ADTs with smart constructors all let you encode business rules at the type/validation boundary. An `UnvalidatedRequisition` and a `ValidatedRequisition` are different types (or shapes); the language prevents you from accidentally treating one as the other. The domain model documents itself regardless of which language you use.

**Railway-Oriented Programming (ROP)** — Error handling becomes a first-class design concern. F# uses `Result<'a, 'e>` with `Result.bind`; Clojure uses `either` monads or threading macros with tagged maps; TypeScript uses a `Result` type or `neverthrow`; Haskell uses `Either e a` with monadic `>>=` and `do`-notation. Multiple fallible steps compose cleanly into pipelines in all four.

**Workflow pipelines** — Business workflows are modelled as plain functions. Dependencies are injected via partial application (F#), higher-order functions (Clojure), constructor injection (TypeScript), or partial application and records-of-functions (Haskell). Effects are pushed to the edges, and the domain core stays pure and easily testable in all four languages.

## Rust as an FP-Adjacent Member — With Concept Adjustments

Rust shares deep DNA with the FP languages on this track: `enum` is a sum type (the Rust Reference explicitly calls it "analogous to a `data` constructor declaration in Haskell" — Blandy & Orendorff, _Programming Rust_, Ch. 10), `match` is exhaustive pattern matching, traits cover much of the territory typeclasses cover, and `Result<T, E>` is the Railway-Oriented Programming primitive built into stdlib. DDD patterns that translate cleanly — value objects as records with smart constructors, aggregates as state-machine ADTs, domain events as `enum` variants, workflows as `fn(input) -> Result<output, Error>` — appear without adjustment. Patterns where ownership is the modelling force (aggregate move semantics, repository owned vs borrowed handles) live in the [in-procedural-by-example](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/domain-driven-design-ddd/in-procedural-by-example) track.

**Six concept adjustments when you read this DDD-in-FP track through a Rust lens:**

1. **Ownership / affine types — no F# equivalent.** Every Rust value is used at most once before it is moved. Workflow steps that produce a new aggregate state typically **consume** the old state (`fn submit(self) -> Result<Submitted, Error>`) rather than copy it. The pure-transition framing this track teaches (`State -> Event -> State`) is preserved, but it is enforced at the ownership layer rather than only at the type layer. (Source: [without.boats — Ownership](https://without.boats/blog/ownership/))
2. **No higher-kinded types (HKT).** Rust cannot abstract over `Result` or `Option` without a concrete type argument. There is **no generic `Functor` or `Monad` trait**, so domain-level "lift this validation into the workflow effect" patterns do not generalise as they do in Haskell or F#. GATs (Rust 1.65) approach but do not reach HKT. (Source: [GAT stabilisation — Matsakis & Huey](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/10/28/gats-stabilization/))
3. **`?` operator is sugar, not monadic bind.** F# `Result.bind` is a generic monadic operation; Rust's `?` expands to a specific early-return `match` after `From::from(e)`. Validation pipelines (`Result.bind validate >> Result.bind normalize >> Result.bind persist`) become `validate(raw)?; normalize(input)?; persist(input)?` — same Railway-Oriented Programming engineering effect, different conceptual machinery. (Source: [Rust By Example — `?` operator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std/result/question_mark.html))
4. **`async` / `Future` is not a monad.** F#'s `async { }` is a monadic computation expression; `asyncResult { }` from FsToolkit composes async and Result monadically. Rust's `async fn` desugars to a `Future` state machine sequenced by the compiler, not by monadic bind. Workflows with async repository calls compose via `.await` plus `?`, not via a generic computation expression.
5. **No persistent immutable shared structures by default.** F# lists / maps / sets share structure via GC. Aggregates with collection fields (`PurchaseOrder` with line items) in Rust use `Vec<Line>` (owned), `&[Line]` (borrowed slice), or `Arc<[Line]>` (shared immutable) — each with different ownership consequences. The `im` crate provides persistent structures when GC-style sharing is required.
6. **Traits ≈ typeclasses minus HKT.** Smart-constructor traits, `Display`, `From`/`Into`, `Iterator` map cleanly. Multi-type-parameter or kind-polymorphic abstractions (Functor for `Result`, Monad for any effect) do not. Repository-as-record-of-functions becomes Repository-as-trait-object (`Box<dyn Repository>`), with the type-level dispatch but without HKT-style abstraction.

Where the FP idiom translates one-to-one, Rust appears as an additional language tab alongside F# / Clojure / TypeScript / Haskell. Where the idiom requires an ownership-driven re-formulation (typestate aggregates, move-on-transition lifecycles, borrowed-vs-owned repository contracts), the example points to the procedural track instead.

## Running Domain

All 80 examples use the same **Procure-to-Pay (P2P) procurement platform** — the backend service (`procurement-platform-be`) that employees use to request goods and services, managers use to approve them, suppliers use to fulfill them, and finance uses to reconcile and pay. The core workflow is:

```
UnvalidatedRequisition → SubmitRequisition → RequisitionSubmitted
                       → ApprovePO         → PurchaseOrderIssued
                       → ReceiveGoods      → GoodsReceived
                       → MatchInvoice      → InvoiceMatched
```

Using a single running domain across all examples lets you see how individual pieces — a `Money` value object, a `Result.bind` chain, a repository modelled as a function type — fit together into a coherent procurement system.

## Structure of Each Example

Every example follows a consistent five-part format:

1. **Brief Explanation**: What concept the example demonstrates (2–3 sentences).
2. **Optional Diagram**: A Mermaid diagram when concept relationships involve state transitions, pipelines, or bounded-context maps. Skipped for straightforward type or function definitions.
3. **Heavily Annotated Code**: Parallel tabs showing F# (canonical), Clojure, TypeScript, and Haskell. Each tab is a single, self-contained code block. Annotations use `// =>` notation (or `;;` in Clojure, `-- =>` in Haskell) to show values, types, states, and effects at each step, targeting 1.0–2.25 comment lines per code line per tab.
4. **Key Takeaway**: The single most important principle from this example (1–2 sentences).
5. **Why It Matters**: Real-world context — why this pattern matters in production systems and how it connects to type-driven DDD (50–100 words).
