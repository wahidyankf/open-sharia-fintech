This section provides a code-first approach to learning software architecture through heavily annotated examples in four functional languages: F# (canonical), Clojure, TypeScript, and Haskell. Each example presents all four languages as parallel tabs — F# carries the deepest annotations and the framing prose, while Clojure, TypeScript, and Haskell are first-class variants showing the same architectural decision in their respective idioms. Each example also mirrors its counterpart in the OOP variant (same number, same conceptual title) so the two paradigms can be compared side-by-side.

## What You Will Learn

The examples in this section cover patterns, principles, architectural styles, trade-offs, and real-world architectural decisions across three progressive levels, expressed in idiomatic F#, Clojure, TypeScript, and Haskell:

- **Beginner**: Foundational architectural concepts with simple, self-contained examples in all four languages
- **Intermediate**: Composite patterns and common enterprise architecture challenges
- **Advanced**: Complex systems, distributed architecture, and nuanced trade-off analysis

## How to Use This Section

Each example is self-contained and annotated to explain not just what the code does, but why each architectural decision was made. The F# tab runs under `dotnet fsi`; the Clojure tab runs as a standalone namespace; the TypeScript tab runs under `ts-node` or `deno`; the Haskell tab runs under `runghc` or `cabal run`. Start at the level that matches your current understanding and progress through the examples in order. Each FP example shares the same number as its OOP counterpart in the [in-oop-by-example](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/patterns-and-principles/in-oop-by-example) sibling tutorial, enabling cross-paradigm comparison.

## Paradigm-Fit Legend

Not every architectural pattern fits every paradigm equally. Many examples carry a **Paradigm Note** banner explaining whether the pattern is FP-native, OOP-native, or paradigm-neutral. The classification follows authoritative sources:

- **NEUTRAL** — paradigm-agnostic concept (microservices, distributed tracing, hexagonal architecture). Both tracks teach legitimately.
- **OOP-NATIVE** — pattern emerged from OOP and is absorbed by FP language features. Norvig (1996, [Design Patterns in Dynamic Languages](https://norvig.com/design-patterns/)) classified 16 of 23 GoF patterns this way. Examples in the FP track show the _native FP idiom_ (HOF, ADT, fold, FRP) rather than reproducing the OOP shape.
- **OOP-NATIVE-BUT-TRANSFERABLE** — OOP roots but the concept transfers cleanly (SOLID, DDD aggregates, Repository). The paradigm note explains the FP encoding.
- **FP-NATIVE** — pattern emerged from or expresses most naturally in FP (Railway-Oriented Programming, Free Monads, Reader/State monads, Event Sourcing fold, FRP, Kleisli composition). Examples 86–90 are FP-native extras; the OOP track carries stubs pointing here.

Authority basis: Norvig 1996; Seemann ([Design patterns across paradigms](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/05/25/Designpatternsacrossparadigms/), 2012; [SOLID: the next step is Functional](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/03/10/solid-the-next-step-is-functional/), 2014); Wlaschin ([Domain Modeling Made Functional](https://pragprog.com/titles/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional/)); Hickey ([Simple Made Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/)); Evans (_Domain-Driven Design_); Fowler ([PEAA](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/)).

## Rust as an FP-Adjacent Member — With Concept Adjustments

Rust shares deep DNA with the FP languages on this track: `enum` is a sum type (the Rust Reference explicitly calls it "analogous to a `data` constructor declaration in Haskell" — Blandy & Orendorff, _Programming Rust_, Ch. 10), `match` is exhaustive pattern matching, traits cover much of the territory typeclasses cover, and `Result<T, E>` is the Railway-Oriented Programming primitive built into stdlib. But the FP concepts taught in this track must be **adjusted** before they translate to Rust — Rust is not "F# with a borrow checker." Patterns that translate one-to-one (sum types, `Result`, pure functions, exhaustive `match`, smart constructors) appear without adjustment. Patterns where ownership is the design force live in the [in-procedural-by-example](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/patterns-and-principles/in-procedural-by-example) track.

**Six concept adjustments when you read this track through a Rust lens:**

1. **Ownership / affine types — no F# equivalent.** Every Rust value is used at most once before it is moved. Passing a captured variable to `map` may invalidate the closure that captured it. The closures, folds, and pipelines this track teaches must account for moves; F# / Haskell GC-managed sharing has no analogue. (Source: [without.boats — Ownership](https://without.boats/blog/ownership/))
2. **No higher-kinded types (HKT).** Rust cannot abstract over `Option` without a type argument — only over `Option<T>`. Therefore Rust has **no generic `Functor` or `Monad` trait**. Each effect type carries its own `map`, `and_then`, etc. Examples 86–90 (Free Monads, Reader, Kleisli, State) express patterns that require HKT in their canonical form; in Rust they collapse to instance-specific combinators or are simulated via Generic Associated Types (GATs, stabilised Rust 1.65) which approach but do not reach HKT. (Source: [GAT stabilisation post — Niko Matsakis & Jack Huey](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/10/28/gats-stabilization/) — explicitly: "not full-blown higher-kinded polymorphism")
3. **`?` operator is sugar, not monadic bind.** F# `Result.bind` is a generic monadic operation; Rust's `?` expands to a specific `match` that returns early on `Err(e)` after `From::from(e)`. The teaching framing "chain fallible steps with `bind`" becomes "short-circuit on `Err` with `?`" — same engineering effect, different conceptual machinery. (Source: [Rust By Example — `?` operator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std/result/question_mark.html))
4. **`async` / `Future` is not a monad.** F#'s `async { }` is a monadic computation expression. Rust's `async fn` desugars to a `Future` state machine sequenced by the compiler, not by a monadic bind. There is no equivalent to `asyncResult { }` as a generic abstraction — `tokio`-ecosystem libraries provide ad-hoc combinators instead.
5. **No persistent immutable shared structures by default.** F# lists / maps / sets share structure via GC. Rust's defaults are owned, not shared. Persistent structures exist in the `im` crate (or via `Arc<T>`), but the default style is "move owned data" rather than "share immutable references."
6. **Traits ≈ typeclasses minus HKT.** Single-type-parameter abstractions (`Display`, `Iterator`, `Clone`) map cleanly. Multi-type-parameter or kind-polymorphic abstractions (Functor, Monad, Free) do not. Read teaching about "typeclass-style abstraction" with this caveat.

Where the FP idiom translates one-to-one, Rust appears as an additional language tab alongside F# / Clojure / TypeScript / Haskell. Where the idiom requires an ownership-driven re-formulation (typestate, RAII, borrowed slices), the example points to the procedural track instead.

## Structure of Each Example

Every example follows a consistent five-part format:

1. **Brief Explanation** — what the pattern or principle addresses and why it matters (2-3 sentences)
2. **Mermaid Diagram** — visual representation of component relationships, pipelines, or data flow (when appropriate)
3. **Heavily Annotated Code** — parallel tabs showing F# (canonical), Clojure, TypeScript, and Haskell, each with `// =>` (or `;;` in Clojure, `-- =>` in Haskell) comments documenting architectural decisions and trade-offs
4. **Key Takeaway** — the core insight to retain from the example (1-2 sentences)
5. **Why It Matters** — production relevance and real-world impact (50-100 words)
