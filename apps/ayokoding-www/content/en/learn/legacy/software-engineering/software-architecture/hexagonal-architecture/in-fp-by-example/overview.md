**Want to build systems where business logic is a pure function that cannot touch a database even if it tries?** This tutorial teaches Hexagonal Architecture through a functional programming lens, using four languages — F# (canonical), Clojure, TypeScript, and Haskell. Each example presents all four as parallel tabs; F# carries the deepest annotations and the framing prose, while Clojure, TypeScript, and Haskell are first-class variants. The central observation is that functional programming and hexagonal architecture solve the same problem from different angles: both insist that the domain core is pure and that all effects live at the edges — and this insight holds equally in all four languages.

## What This Tutorial Covers

Hexagonal Architecture in functional languages rests on three interlocking ideas that make the structural boundaries impossible to violate accidentally. Each idea is expressed differently across F#, Clojure, TypeScript, and Haskell, but the constraint is identical in all four:

**Ports as function contracts** — In F#, a port is a record type alias with named function fields. In Clojure, a port is a protocol or a plain map of functions. In TypeScript, a port is an interface or an object type with function properties. In Haskell, a port is a record of functions (the canonical "record-of-functions" idiom for runtime dependency injection). In all four, the compiler (or runtime) enforces substitutability without inheritance.

**Adapters as function implementations** — An adapter satisfies a port contract: a PostgreSQL adapter and an in-memory test adapter satisfy the same port. Swap adapters by passing different records / maps / objects at startup — no DI container or reflection needed in any of the four languages.

**Dependency injection via function application** — Application services take their port implementations as parameters. In F#, partial application bakes in the production adapters. In Clojure, higher-order functions or component systems do the same. In TypeScript, constructor injection or closure-based factories achieve the equivalent result. In Haskell, partial application or a `Reader` monad threading a record of functions through pure code provides the same compositional guarantee.

## The Functional Core / Imperative Shell Connection

The functional core / imperative shell pattern and hexagonal architecture are the same insight expressed in different vocabularies:

| Functional term                | Hexagonal term                   |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Functional core                | Domain core                      |
| Imperative shell               | Adapters                         |
| Effect-free function           | Domain function                  |
| Side-effecting function        | Adapter function                 |
| Partial application of effects | Dependency injection of adapters |

Both demand that the centre is pure. Both push effects to the boundary. Both enable easy testing by substituting the effectful shell.

## Rust as an FP-Adjacent Member — With Concept Adjustments

Rust shares deep DNA with the FP languages on this track: `enum` is a sum type (Blandy & Orendorff, _Programming Rust_, Ch. 10), traits cover much of the territory typeclasses cover, and `Result<T, E>` is the Railway-Oriented Programming primitive natively. Hexagonal idioms that translate cleanly — output ports as traits, adapter implementations satisfying those traits, in-memory test adapters, dependency injection via constructor arguments — appear without adjustment. Patterns where ownership is the design force (move-on-call ports, borrowed input adapters) live in the [in-procedural-by-example](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/hexagonal-architecture/in-procedural-by-example) track.

**Six concept adjustments when you read this hexagonal-in-FP track through a Rust lens:**

1. **Ownership / affine types — no F# equivalent.** Every Rust value is used at most once before it is moved. Port methods that take an aggregate may **consume** it (`fn save(self, agg: PurchaseOrder)`) or **borrow** it (`fn save(&self, agg: &PurchaseOrder)`); the choice is a port-design decision with no F# counterpart. Partial application as DI becomes "store the dependency in a struct field" with explicit ownership/borrowing rules. (Source: [without.boats — Ownership](https://without.boats/blog/ownership/))
2. **No higher-kinded types (HKT).** F# / Haskell can express "any effect monad implementing this port" abstractly; Rust cannot. Rust's `async fn` in traits (stabilised in 1.75) closes part of the gap, but kind-polymorphic abstraction over "any port-shaped effect" is not available. (Source: [GAT stabilisation — Matsakis & Huey](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/10/28/gats-stabilization/))
3. **`?` operator is sugar, not monadic bind.** Hexagonal application services that chain port calls in F# use `Result.bind` or `asyncResult { }`; in Rust they use `.await?` repeatedly. Same engineering effect, different machinery. (Source: [Rust By Example — `?` operator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std/result/question_mark.html))
4. **`async` / `Future` is not a monad.** F# `Async<Result<>>` composition uses computation expressions; Rust uses `async fn` + `.await` + `?` and concrete `Future` state machines. There is no `asyncResult { }` equivalent as a generic monadic abstraction. Adapter implementations that need parallel composition use `tokio::try_join!` or `futures::future::try_join_all` — ad-hoc combinators, not monadic algebra.
5. **No persistent immutable shared structures by default.** Composition roots in F# typically wire records-of-functions captured by closures; in Rust, dependencies are held in `Arc<dyn Trait>` for shared ownership across threads. The wiring shape transfers; the sharing mechanism changes.
6. **Traits ≈ typeclasses minus HKT (but trait objects fill much of the gap).** A port is a `trait Repository { async fn save(&self, po: &PurchaseOrder) -> Result<(), RepoError>; }`. Adapters implement this trait. Application services accept `Arc<dyn Repository>` or generic `R: Repository`. This is type-level dispatch akin to typeclasses — minus the kind-polymorphism Haskell offers.

Where the FP idiom translates one-to-one, Rust appears as an additional language tab alongside F# / Clojure / TypeScript / Haskell. Where the idiom requires an ownership-driven re-formulation (typestate-encoded port contracts, owned-vs-borrowed adapter handles, `Send + Sync` bounds at the composition root), the example points to the procedural track instead.

## Running Domain

All 75 examples use the same **procurement-platform-be** — the backend of a Procure-to-Pay (P2P) platform where employees request goods and services, managers approve, suppliers fulfil, and finance pays. The core workflow is:

```
Employee submits PurchaseOrder draft
  → AwaitingApproval (approval router port routes to manager)
  → Approved (L1/L2/L3 based on PO total)
  → Issued (supplier notifier port sends EDI/email)
  → Received (goods receipt note recorded)
  → Invoiced (three-way match: PO ↔ GRN ↔ Invoice)
  → Paid (banking port disburses funds)
```

This is the same domain used in the [DDD By Example in FP](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/domain-driven-design-ddd/in-fp-by-example/overview) tutorial, and the same domain shown in F#, Clojure, TypeScript, and Haskell tabs throughout both tutorials. The two tutorials complement each other: the DDD tutorial teaches how to model the domain; this tutorial teaches how to isolate it from infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Follow whichever language tab matches the stack you ship. For each language you plan to read:

- **F# (canonical tab)**: comfortable with `let` bindings, function definitions, modules, discriminated unions, and record types. `Result<'a, 'e>` and `Async<'a>` familiarity required; several examples use `asyncResult { }` from [FsToolkit.ErrorHandling](https://github.com/demystifyfp/FsToolkit.ErrorHandling).
- **Clojure tab**: comfortable with namespaces, maps, protocols, and `->` / `->>` threading macros. Familiarity with `clojure.spec` or `malli` is helpful for the type-grounding examples.
- **TypeScript tab**: comfortable with interfaces, generics, `async/await`, and a basic `Result` type (e.g., `neverthrow`). Familiarity with Zod for runtime validation is helpful.
- **DDD FP tutorial helpful but not required**: if you have read the [DDD By Example in FP](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/domain-driven-design-ddd/in-fp-by-example/overview) tutorial first, you will recognise the domain types and smart constructors used here across all three language tabs.

## Structure of Each Example

Every example follows a consistent five-part format:

1. **Brief Explanation**: What hexagonal concept the example demonstrates (2–3 sentences).
2. **Optional Diagram**: A Mermaid diagram when concept relationships involve zones, port/adapter boundaries, or flow across layers. Skipped for straightforward type or function definitions.
3. **Heavily Annotated Code**: Parallel tabs showing F# (canonical), Clojure, and TypeScript. Each tab is a single, self-contained code block. Annotations use `// =>` notation to show values, types, zones, and flow at each step, targeting 1.0–2.25 comment lines per code line per tab.
4. **Key Takeaway**: The single most important principle from this example (1–2 sentences).
5. **Why It Matters**: Real-world context — why this structural boundary matters in production systems (50–100 words).
