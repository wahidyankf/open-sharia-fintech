## Prerequisites

- **Prior topics**: [10 · SQL Essentials](../../sql-essentials/learning/overview.md) -- `SELECT`,
  `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`/`HAVING`, `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`, foreign keys, basic transactions
  (`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`), and the first Python `sqlite3` examples this topic assumes as a floor and
  then extends into a real client-server engine; [4 · Just Enough Python](../../just-enough-python/learning/overview.md)
  -- the type-annotated Python fluency this topic's data-access-layer examples assume; [11 ·
  Backend Essentials](../../backend-essentials/learning/overview.md) -- the N+1 query scenario that
  topic introduces at the application layer, which this topic's co-26 (N+1 diagnosis and fix,
  Examples 54-56) diagnoses and resolves from the database side.
- **Tools & environment**: a macOS/Linux terminal; **PostgreSQL 18.x** (the `psql` client and a
  running server -- Docker's `postgres:18` image is the simplest way to get one); **Python 3.x**
  with `psycopg` (v3, `pip install "psycopg[binary]"`) installed in a `venv`; Example 76
  additionally needs `psycopg-pool` (`pip install psycopg-pool`).
- **Assumed knowledge**: comfort writing and running `SELECT`/`JOIN`/`GROUP BY` queries and basic
  Python scripts (topic 10). No prior exposure to window functions, query planning, or transaction
  isolation is assumed -- this topic is where those begin.

## Why this exists -- the big idea

**The problem before the solution**: correct SQL can still be catastrophically slow -- the query
that flew on 100 rows melts at 10 million, and you cannot see _why_ without the planner.
**Keep-this-if-you-forget-everything**: the database does what you ask, well or badly; `EXPLAIN` is
how you see the _how_, and an index is a space-and-write-cost bargain you make to buy read speed.

**Cross-cutting big ideas, taught here and then reused for the rest of this curriculum**:
`consistency-latency-throughput` -- isolation levels and locking trade correctness guarantees
against concurrency and speed; `abstraction-and-its-cost` -- indexes and denormalization buy reads
by charging writes and storage.

## Confirm your toolchain

Every example in this topic runs against a real, running PostgreSQL 18 server:

```text
$ psql --version
psql (PostgreSQL) 18.4
$ psql -U asqp -d asqp -c "SELECT version();"
PostgreSQL 18.4 on aarch64-unknown-linux-musl, compiled by gcc ...
```

Every SQL example is a complete, self-contained, runnable `.sql` file colocated under
`learning/code/`, and every Python example is a complete, self-contained, runnable `.py` file --
both actually executed against a real PostgreSQL 18.4 instance (via Docker, `postgres:18.4-alpine`,
with `shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'` for Example 82) to capture the documented
output. Every query result, `EXPLAIN` plan, timing number, and server log excerpt on this topic's
pages is a genuine, captured transcript, never a fabricated one -- including the exact PostgreSQL 18
plan-output details that changed from prior versions (`Buffers:` shown by default under `EXPLAIN
ANALYZE`, fractional row counts on loop-averaged estimates, `Index Searches:` and `Heap Fetches:`
lines, and the new B-tree skip-scan capability).

## How this topic's examples are organized

- **[Beginner](./beginner.md)** (Examples 1-28) -- uncorrelated and correlated subqueries, derived
  tables, common table expressions (`WITH`) including a first recursive counter and tree walk, the
  four core window-function building blocks (running total, partitioned average, ranking functions,
  `LAG`/`LEAD`), `NTILE` quartiles, `UNION`/`INTERSECT`/`EXCEPT` set operations, `GROUP BY ROLLUP`
  and grouping sets, `FILTER`-based conditional aggregation, transactions (`BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/
  `ROLLBACK`) and a genuine atomicity-failure demonstration, creating a B-tree index, `EXPLAIN` and
  `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` basics, `ANALYZE` refreshing planner statistics, `FOR UPDATE` row locking and
  the default Read Committed isolation level (both via real two-session Python scripts), and `psql`'s
  `\timing`.
- **[Intermediate](./intermediate.md)** (Examples 29-64) -- rewriting a correlated subquery as a
  join, cycle-safe recursive CTEs over graphs and a bill-of-materials explosion, moving averages,
  explicit `RANGE` vs. `ROWS` window frames, the `FIRST_VALUE`/`LAST_VALUE` default-frame gotcha,
  `PERCENT_RANK`/`CUME_DIST`, top-N-per-group, `LATERAL` joins, `CUBE` crosstabs, every specialized
  index type PostgreSQL ships (composite, covering, partial, expression, hash, GIN, BRIN) with the
  write-cost and bloat tradeoffs each one carries, all three `EXPLAIN` join-node types (nested loop
  with `Memoize`, hash join, merge join) forced deterministically for teaching, `Buffers` in a real
  plan, a stale-statistics misestimate, the N+1 query problem diagnosed and fixed two ways in Python,
  every classic read anomaly PostgreSQL's isolation levels can and cannot produce (non-repeatable
  read, PostgreSQL's stronger-than-standard phantom-read prevention, write skew, and a genuine
  `SerializationFailure` retry), a real reproduced deadlock and its consistent-ordering fix, advisory
  locks, and a plain materialized view refresh.
- **[Advanced](./advanced.md)** (Examples 65-85) -- a recursive-CTE shortest path over a weighted
  graph, gaps-and-islands window sessionization, a measured window-function-vs-self-join
  performance gap (687x on this data), a multi-`LATERAL` dashboard report, deliberate covering-index
  design, `CREATE STATISTICS` for correlated columns, declarative range partitioning with verified
  pruning and a measured bulk-delete tradeoff against a single big index, denormalization measured
  honestly in both directions (reads faster, writes costlier), a non-blocking `REFRESH ...
CONCURRENTLY` proven via real thread timing, a connection-pooling benchmark, the full
  isolation-level anomaly matrix side by side, `SERIALIZABLE`'s measured bookkeeping overhead and
  real retry rate under contention, buffer-driven I/O tuning, a genuine planner-cost-constant plan
  flip, slow-query-log triage, `pg_stat_statements` top-N ranking (with its non-default setup
  prerequisites stated explicitly), OLTP-normalized vs. OLAP star-schema query shape, `COPY` vs.
  row-`INSERT` bulk-load throughput, and a closing example that threads a window report, index
  tuning, an N+1 fix, and a concurrency anomaly's reproduction-and-resolution into one workflow.

## The 28 concepts this topic covers

- **co-01 · Subqueries and derived tables** -- correlated vs. uncorrelated subqueries and subqueries
  used as derived tables in `FROM`.
- **co-02 · Common table expressions** -- `WITH` factoring a query into named, readable steps.
- **co-03 · Recursive CTEs** -- `WITH RECURSIVE` walking hierarchies and graphs with a termination
  guard.
- **co-04 · Window functions** -- `OVER()` computing across a row set without collapsing rows into
  groups.
- **co-05 · Window frames and partitions** -- `PARTITION BY` / `ORDER BY` / the `ROWS` vs. `RANGE`
  frame clause.
- **co-06 · Ranking and analytic functions** -- `ROW_NUMBER`/`RANK`/`DENSE_RANK`, `LAG`/`LEAD`,
  `NTILE`, `PERCENT_RANK`.
- **co-07 · Set operations** -- `UNION`/`INTERSECT`/`EXCEPT` and their `ALL` variants.
- **co-08 · Grouping sets, ROLLUP, CUBE** -- multi-level aggregation (subtotals, grand totals,
  crosstabs) in one pass.
- **co-09 · LATERAL joins** -- `LATERAL` correlating a subquery to each row of the left side.
- **co-10 · Conditional aggregation** -- `FILTER (WHERE ...)` and `CASE`-based aggregates for
  pivots.
- **co-11 · ACID properties** -- atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability defined
  concretely.
- **co-12 · MVCC** -- multi-version concurrency control: readers see a snapshot and don't block
  writers.
- **co-13 · Isolation levels** -- Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable and the
  anomalies each forbids.
- **co-14 · Read phenomena** -- dirty read, non-repeatable read, phantom, and write skew as named
  anomalies.
- **co-15 · Serializable snapshot isolation** -- PostgreSQL SSI detecting dangerous dependency
  structures and aborting.
- **co-16 · Explicit locking** -- row locks (`FOR UPDATE`/`FOR SHARE`), advisory locks, and lock
  modes.
- **co-17 · Database deadlocks** -- how the engine detects a lock cycle and how consistent lock
  ordering avoids it.
- **co-18 · B-tree index mechanics** -- the sorted-tree index and why equality, range, and ordering
  all benefit.
- **co-19 · Composite and covering indexes** -- column order, index-only scans, and `INCLUDE`
  columns.
- **co-20 · Specialized indexes** -- hash, GIN, GiST, and BRIN indexes and the workload each fits.
- **co-21 · Partial and expression indexes** -- indexing a predicate subset or a computed
  expression.
- **co-22 · Index cost tradeoff** -- write amplification, bloat, and when an index hurts more than
  it helps.
- **co-23 · EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE** -- estimated vs. actual plans; PostgreSQL 18 shows buffer
  stats by default.
- **co-24 · Reading a query plan** -- scan and join node types (nested loop / hash / merge), cost,
  rows, width.
- **co-25 · Table statistics and ANALYZE** -- the planner depends on `ANALYZE` stats; stale stats
  cause bad plans.
- **co-26 · N+1 diagnosis and fix** -- the app-side query explosion and its join / batch fixes.
- **co-27 · Denormalization and materialized views** -- trading write cost and storage for read
  speed.
- **co-28 · Partitioning, pooling, and OLTP vs. OLAP** -- declarative partitioning, connection
  pooling, and workload-shaped schema.
