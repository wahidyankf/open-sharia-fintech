## Prerequisites

- **Prior topics**: [15 · Software Testing](../../software-testing/learning/overview.md) --
  verifying an agent's output leans directly on writing and running the tests that catch a wrong
  generation; [30 · Software Engineering
  Practices](../../software-engineering-practices/learning/overview.md) -- code review, small
  commits, and working in trunk are exactly the discipline this topic applies to an agent's output
  instead of a human's.
- **Tools & environment**: an AI coding agent/assistant (editor-integrated and/or CLI); a
  version-controlled repo for safe, reversible iteration; a fast test suite as the verification
  harness; Neovim/VSCode with the agent integration. Code-medium examples use Python 3.13
  (standard-library-only), POSIX Bash, TypeScript, and Gherkin -- each example states which.
- **Assumed knowledge**: writing and running tests to verify a change (topic 15); code review, small
  commits, and working in trunk (topic 30); reading code in more than one language (the earlier
  primers).

## Why this exists -- the big idea

**The problem before the solution**: an agent will produce plausible, confident, wrong code fast --
used naively it accelerates the creation of bugs and quietly erodes the author's understanding of
their own codebase. **The one idea worth keeping if you forget everything else**: the agent drafts,
you verify -- treat generated code as an untrusted contribution that must pass the same tests,
review, and reasoning as any other, and keep a tight loop where you check before you build on it.

## How this topic's examples are organized

- **[Beginner](./beginner.md)** (Examples 1-18) -- what agentic coding is (and is not), the
  perceive/plan/act/observe loop, context-window budgeting and pruning, writing a well-specified
  prompt, instruction files and their precedence, first-tool-call and tool-call-log discipline, plan
  mode before act mode, running the suite before accepting a diff, spotting a hallucinated API, and
  calibrating how closely to review delegated work.
- **[Intermediate](./intermediate.md)** (Examples 19-40) -- configuring and calling an MCP server,
  delegating to a subagent and fanning out two in parallel, permission deny/allow-list configs,
  sandboxed shell commands and small reversible commits, driving a full red-green-refactor cycle with
  an agent, diff-review checklists and catching scope creep, budgeting and comparing prompt cost,
  probing and sanitizing against prompt injection, loading and comparing against an agent skill,
  writing a spec before prompting (including a Gherkin-driven implementation), and iterating on a
  failed first attempt across multiple rounds.
- **[Advanced](./advanced.md)** (Examples 41-54) -- escalating a security-critical change, declining
  to delegate a genuinely novel algorithm, refusing unverifiable output, a mid-session human decision
  gate, a context-managed multi-file feature loop, a mechanical refactor across files with per-file
  approval, catching a confidently wrong refactor via a regression test, a full trust/verify decision
  log, an MCP-plus-subagent research task, a prompt-injection guardrail configuration, a spec-driven
  TDD session, a full verify-first feature session, cost-bounded iterative refinement, and a
  post-mortem of a bad agent merge.
- **[Capstone](./capstone/overview.md)** -- one real feature (`parse_duration`), landed under a
  verify-first discipline: a specified prompt with a failing tripwire test, a driven session that
  catches and rejects one genuinely wrong generation before reaching green, and a written trust/verify
  decision log.

Every code-medium example is a complete, self-contained, runnable file colocated under
`learning/code/`, actually executed to capture its documented output -- every printed transcript on
this topic's pages is genuine, never fabricated. Every artifact-medium example (a recorded prompt,
session transcript, or config with no runnable code) also lives standalone under `learning/artifacts/`
-- this topic is polyglot and workflow-shaped: the target language and artifact format vary by
example, the loop and the verify-before-you-build-on-it discipline do not.

## The 24 concepts this topic covers

- **co-01 · What is agentic coding** -- an agent that autonomously reads a repo, plans, edits, runs
  tools, and iterates, distinct from single-shot autocomplete or snippet generation. Example 1.
- **co-02 · The perceive/plan/act/observe loop** -- coding agents run an interleaved
  reasoning-and-acting loop (ReAct-style): observe state, reason about the next step, act via a tool,
  then observe the result before reasoning again. Example 2.
- **co-03 · Context-window fundamentals** -- the agent reasons only within a finite context-window
  budget, so what is or is not loaded directly shapes output quality. Example 3.
- **co-04 · Context management** -- deliberately curating what enters the context window and
  pruning what does not, since more context is not always better. Examples 4, 45.
- **co-05 · Prompting for code** -- a well-specified prompt states the goal, constraints, examples,
  and acceptance criteria up front rather than leaving them implicit. Examples 5, 6, 52.
- **co-06 · Instruction files** -- a persistent, repo-level file (AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md) the agent
  reads automatically to learn build/test commands and conventions without being re-told each
  session. Examples 7, 8.
- **co-07 · Tool use and function calling** -- the agent acts by invoking discrete named tools with
  structured parameters rather than free-form text output. Examples 9, 10.
- **co-08 · MCP (Model Context Protocol)** -- an open, JSON-RPC-based protocol standardizing how a
  host application connects an agent to external tools, resources, and prompts across vendors.
  Examples 19, 20, 49.
- **co-09 · Plan mode vs. act mode** -- separating a read-only exploration/planning phase from a
  write-enabled execution phase, with an explicit approval step between them. Examples 11, 12, 52.
- **co-10 · Subagents and orchestration** -- delegating a bounded sub-task to an isolated agent
  context so its exploration detail stays out of the main conversation and only a summary returns.
  Examples 21, 22, 45, 49.
- **co-11 · Permissions and guardrails** -- explicit allow/deny/ask rules constraining which tools,
  paths, or commands an agent may use, enforced by the harness rather than the model. Examples 23,
  24, 50.
- **co-12 · Sandboxing and reversibility** -- isolating risky agent actions and preferring small,
  independently revertable steps over one large change. Examples 25, 26.
- **co-13 · Verification discipline** -- reading, running the test suite, and reviewing the diff
  before building on any agent output. Examples 13, 43, 47, 52, 54.
- **co-14 · Test-driven agent workflows** -- giving the agent a failing test as the acceptance bar
  and driving it to green through a red-green-refactor cycle. Examples 27, 28, 51.
- **co-15 · Diff review** -- applying the same code-review scrutiny to an agent-generated diff as to
  any human contribution before accepting it. Examples 14, 29, 30, 46, 52.
- **co-16 · Hallucination awareness** -- an agent can generate plausible, confident, and entirely
  nonexistent APIs or behavior, which only verification against a real source catches. Examples 15,
  47, 54.
- **co-17 · Trust-vs-verify calibration** -- deciding, task by task, which work is safe to delegate
  lightly versus which demands close human review. Examples 16, 17, 46, 48.
- **co-18 · Cost and token budgeting** -- an agent session consumes tokens/cost per turn, so
  multi-turn iterative work needs an explicit budget and stopping condition. Examples 18, 31, 32, 53.
- **co-19 · Prompt-injection risk** -- untrusted content the agent reads can embed instructions that
  hijack the agent's goal unless guarded against. Examples 33, 34, 50.
- **co-20 · Agent skills** -- a packaged, filesystem-based procedure the agent loads on demand
  instead of re-deriving or re-pasting the same guidance each session. Examples 35, 36.
- **co-21 · Spec-driven development** -- writing an executable specification and acceptance criteria
  first, then using the agent to implement against that spec rather than an ad hoc prompt. Examples
  37, 38, 51.
- **co-22 · When not to use agents** -- high-stakes, novel, or cheaply-unverifiable work where
  delegating would trade understanding and safety for speed the situation cannot afford. Examples 41,
  42, 43, 54.
- **co-23 · Iterative refinement** -- treating agent output as a multi-round correction loop rather
  than expecting one-shot correctness. Examples 39, 40, 53.
- **co-24 · Human-in-the-loop** -- keeping an explicit human decision point at every risky boundary
  in a session rather than granting the agent full autonomy end to end. Examples 41, 44, 48, 53.
