## Prerequisites

- **Prior topics**: [4 · Just Enough Python](../../just-enough-python/learning/overview.md) -- every
  script in this topic is fully type-annotated Python, and you should already be comfortable reading
  functions, classes, exceptions, and `list`/`dict` literals the way that primer taught them; [5 ·
  Just Enough Bash](../../just-enough-bash/learning/overview.md) -- every example is driven from a
  terminal, and several examples pipe commands, background a process with `&`, or read an exit code
  the way that primer taught; [15 · Software Testing](../../software-testing/learning/overview.md) --
  this topic assumes you can already write a failing pytest-style assertion and read a traceback; a
  test tells you **that** something is wrong, this topic is about finding **where** and **why**, then
  measuring whether a fix actually helped.
- **Tools & environment**: a macOS/Linux terminal; **Python 3.13.12** (stdlib `pdb`, `cProfile`,
  `pstats`, `tracemalloc`, `threading`, `asyncio`, `sys.monitoring` -- no extra install needed) plus
  **py-spy 0.4.2**, **debugpy 1.8.21**, **line_profiler 5.0.2** (provides `kernprof`), **hypothesis
  6.156.6**, **gprof2dot 2025.4.14**, and **snakeviz 2.2.2** from PyPI; **Python 3.14.3** for the two
  examples that need pdb's 3.14-only remote-attach and `set_trace_async` features; **git 2.39.5+** for
  the bisection examples; **inferno** (`cargo install inferno`) for flame-graph rendering; on Linux,
  **gdb 17.2+** (bundles Python-awareness via `python-gdb.py`) and **perf** (ships with the Linux
  kernel's `linux-tools` package) for the native-debugging tier; on macOS, **lldb** (ships with Xcode
  Command Line Tools) plus **cpython_lldb 0.3.3** from PyPI.
- **Assumed knowledge**: reading and writing typed Python functions and classes; running a program
  and reading its exit code from a Bash terminal; writing a plain `assert`-based test. No prior
  debugging or profiling background is required -- this topic is where that background starts.

## Why this exists -- the big idea

**The problem before the solution**: a failing test tells you something is wrong but not where or
why; `print`-driven guessing scales poorly as a codebase grows, and optimizing by hunch tunes the
wrong 90% of the code while the real bottleneck sits untouched, unmeasured. **The one idea worth
keeping if you forget everything else**: debugging is a search -- form a falsifiable hypothesis,
change exactly one thing, observe, and halve the remaining search space; performance work is
measure-first, because the hot spot is almost never where you would have guessed by reading the code.

**Cross-cutting big ideas, taught here and then reused for the rest of this topic**:
`layering-and-leaks` -- a bug or a hot spot usually lives at a seam between layers (your code, the
runtime, the OS, the CPU cache), and a profiler or a native-aware debugger is how you see through
that layer instead of guessing at it (the Native & Systems tier makes this literal: the same slow
function looks completely different from `cProfile`'s Python-only view versus a native-aware view).
`determinism-vs-emergence` -- the hardest bugs are emergent, not local: a data race or an `asyncio`
interleaving bug depends on the interaction between threads or tasks, not on any single line, so it
is only reproducible by controlling that interaction (a forced yield, a seed, a barrier), never
merely by rereading the code closely enough.

## Install and run your first example

Confirm the core toolchain this topic's Beginner tier uses is installed:

```text
$ python3 --version
Python 3.13.12
$ python3 -m pdb --help > /dev/null && echo "pdb OK"
pdb OK
$ python3 -c "import cProfile, pstats, tracemalloc; print('stdlib profiling OK')"
stdlib profiling OK
$ git --version
git version 2.39.5
```

Install the packages the Intermediate/Advanced/Native & Systems tiers need with one `pip` command
(ideally into a virtual environment):

```text
pip install py-spy==0.4.2 debugpy==1.8.21 line_profiler==5.0.2 hypothesis==6.156.6 \
  gprof2dot==2025.4.14 snakeviz==2.2.2
```

**A note on versions**: this topic's examples were authored and verified against these exact tool
versions, in this sandbox, on 2026-07-15. `pdb`, `cProfile`, `tracemalloc`, and `git bisect` are
stdlib/core-tool features that have been stable for many releases; the two examples that need Python
3.14's remote-attach (`python -m pdb -p <pid>`) and `pdb.set_trace_async()` are called out explicitly
where they appear.

Every example is a complete, self-contained runnable file (or command sequence) colocated under
`learning/code/`, actually executed to capture its documented output. Where an example genuinely
needs a privilege or a host this sandbox does not have (root access for `py-spy` on macOS, a Linux
kernel for `perf`, macOS Developer Mode for `lldb` attach), that limitation is stated honestly, backed
by the tool's own error message or documentation, rather than a fabricated transcript standing in for
it -- see the [Native & Systems tier](./native-and-systems.md)'s opening note for the full, itemized
account of every such limitation and its real, disclosed substitute.

## How this topic's examples are organized

- **[Beginner](./beginner.md)** (Examples 1-27) -- `pdb`'s core vocabulary: breakpoints, stepping,
  the call stack, conditional breaks, `display`, post-mortem debugging, `print`/logging versus
  interactive debugging, plus a first pass through `cProfile`, `tracemalloc`, flame-graph reading, and
  `git bisect` by hand.
- **[Intermediate](./intermediate.md)** (Examples 28-49) -- `py-spy`'s `top`/`record`/`dump` (and the
  honest substitute used where root access is unavailable), sorting `pstats` by `tottime` versus
  `cumtime`, line-level profiling with `kernprof`, `tracemalloc` diffing, `debugpy`/DAP remote attach,
  automated `git bisect run`, and delta-debugging with a hand-rolled `ddmin` and with Hypothesis's
  shrinker.
- **[Advanced](./advanced.md)** (Examples 50-62) -- `pdb`'s `interact` mode and chained-exception
  `exceptions` command, multi-module log correlation, converting a profile to a flame graph via
  `gprof2dot`, a real Neovim DAP session, a documented before/after `cProfile` measurement, a genuine
  threading race reproduced and fixed, an `asyncio` interleaving bug, `pdb.set_trace_async()`,
  `multiprocessing` versus `threading` under load, automated bisection of a performance regression,
  and delta-debugging a 10,000-line crash.
- **[Native & Systems](./native-and-systems.md)** (Examples 63-80) -- `gdb`/`lldb`/`perf`-level
  native-aware debugging and profiling of the CPython process itself (with every host limitation
  disclosed honestly), plus the topic's integrative discipline examples: a combined
  correctness-and-performance bug, the recursive `tottime`-versus-`cumtime` trap, an unbounded-cache
  leak, import-time profiling, lock contention under load, a flame-graph diff, deterministic seeding
  for a flaky bug, bisecting with a flaky-test guard, and a low-overhead `sys.monitoring` tracer.
- **[Capstone](./capstone/overview.md)** -- one repository carrying both a seeded correctness bug and
  a seeded performance bug, resolved end to end: bisect and minimize the failing input, fix it with a
  debugger-guided, test-first change, then profile (two independent ways), fix, and measure the hot
  path with zero regressions.

## The 23 concepts this topic covers

- **co-01 · Interactive breakpoints and stepping** -- pausing execution at a chosen line and driving
  it forward with step-into / step-over / step-out, versus letting it run to completion. Examples
  1-3, 14, 25-26, 39, 54, 59.
- **co-02 · Conditional and watch breakpoints** -- halting only when a predicate holds (`i == 47`,
  `id(obj) == ...`) or a value changes, instead of stopping on every hit. Examples 8-11, 38-39.
- **co-03 · Call-stack, frame, and variable inspection** -- reading the stack, moving between frames,
  and printing or mutating locals at a paused point to test a hypothesis. Examples 4-7, 25, 32, 50-51, 64.
- **co-04 · Post-mortem debugging** -- entering a debugger on an already-thrown, uncaught exception
  (`pdb.pm()`, `python -m pdb`) to inspect the failing frame without a rerun. Examples 15-16, 42, 51,
  66, 72.
- **co-05 · Print/logging versus interactive debugging** -- when `print`/`logging` beats a breakpoint
  (long-lived processes, production, timing) and when it does not (one-off, deep state). Examples
  12-13, 52.
- **co-06 · Remote and DAP debugging** -- attaching a debugger to an already-running process over the
  Debug Adapter Protocol (`debugpy`, editor DAP) or `pdb -p <pid>`. Examples 40-42, 54, 59.
- **co-07 · Scientific-method debugging loop** -- expected-vs-actual, one falsifiable hypothesis, one
  change, observe, repeat -- debugging as controlled experiment, not guessing. Examples 7, 23, 50, 78.
- **co-08 · Bisection search as a general strategy** -- halving the search space (commits, input, code
  region) to localize a fault in logarithmic rather than linear steps. Examples 22, 24, 43.
- **co-09 · `git bisect`, manual** -- driving `git bisect start`/`good`/`bad` by hand to name the
  commit that introduced a regression. Examples 22, 72.
- **co-10 · `git bisect`, automated** -- `git bisect run <script>` with a pass/fail (or 125-skip) exit
  code so the whole search runs unattended. Examples 43-44, 61, 72, 79.
- **co-11 · Delta-debugging input minimization** -- shrinking a failing input to a 1-minimal
  reproducer (hand-rolled `ddmin`, Hypothesis shrinking) so every remaining piece is necessary.
  Examples 24, 45-47, 62.
- **co-12 · Sampling versus instrumenting profilers** -- periodic stack sampling (low overhead,
  statistical) versus per-call instrumentation (exact counts, high overhead), and when each is right.
  Examples 28-29.
- **co-13 · CPU profiling with `cProfile`** -- the stdlib instrumenting profiler: running it from the
  CLI or programmatically and reading its `pstats` table. Examples 17-18, 28, 33, 35, 53, 55, 70,
  72-73, 75.
- **co-14 · CPU profiling with `py-spy`** -- a sampling profiler that attaches to a live PID with no
  code changes (`top`, `record`, `dump`, `--native`) -- and the honest, disclosed substitute
  (`mini_sampler.py`, built from `sys._current_frames()`) used wherever root access is unavailable.
  Examples 28-32, 60, 71.
- **co-15 · Wall-clock versus CPU time** -- distinguishing elapsed time (`perf_counter`) from on-CPU
  time (`process_time`); I/O-bound versus CPU-bound diagnosis. Examples 19, 60, 76.
- **co-16 · `tottime` versus `cumtime`** -- a function's own time versus time including callees, and
  which one to optimize (many-cheap leaf versus one-expensive parent). Examples 18, 33, 73.
- **co-17 · Memory profiling with `tracemalloc`** -- snapshotting allocations, diffing two snapshots to
  find a leak, and widening the traceback (`nframe`) to split allocation sites. Examples 20, 36-37, 74.
- **co-18 · Line-level profiling** -- attributing cost to individual source lines (`line_profiler`'s
  `@profile` plus `kernprof`), one resolution finer than function-level. Examples 34-35.
- **co-19 · Flame-graph reading** -- width = total time in a call subtree, height = stack depth;
  finding the widest frame (the hot spot), not the tallest stack. Examples 21, 30-31, 53, 68-69, 71, 77.
- **co-20 · Race and heisenbug reproduction** -- forcing nondeterministic concurrency bugs to
  reproduce reliably (forced yields, seeds, barriers) before attempting a fix. Examples 56-58, 76,
  78-79.
- **co-21 · Load-representative versus toy profiling** -- profiling at realistic scale and
  concurrency, because the hot spot at 100 items or a single call differs from production. Examples
  48-49, 60, 76.
- **co-22 · Native-layer costs and native debugging** -- seeing costs the interpreter hides:
  `gdb`/`lldb` Python-aware backtraces, `perf` with Python perf-maps, `py-spy --native`, core dumps.
  Examples 63-68, 70-71, 75, 80.
- **co-23 · Before/after measurement discipline** -- proving a fix with a repeated, documented
  measurement, and confirming zero regressions. Examples 27, 55, 57, 72, 74-75, 77, 80.
