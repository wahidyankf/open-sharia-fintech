/**
 * Regression: the course-paths plan's Phase 3 e2e run surfaced a real, previously-undetected race
 * in `ContentService.getIndex()`. Its lazy-build guard (`if (!this.contentIndex) { ... }`) is
 * synchronous-check / asynchronous-fill, so multiple callers that all arrive before the very first
 * build resolves (a routine event under Playwright's multi-worker, multi-project concurrent load,
 * where several requests hit the shared server before its content index is warm) each independently
 * trigger their own full `buildContentIndex()` — whichever finishes LAST silently overwrites the
 * cached index for the lifetime of the process. If that last-finishing build ever raced against
 * transient resource pressure (many concurrent full-tree scans opening file handles at once) and
 * came back incomplete, every subsequent request — including totally unrelated ones — would see a
 * permanently wrong, silently-degraded content index for as long as the server keeps running.
