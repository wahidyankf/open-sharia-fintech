/**
 * Load every path manifest under `manifestsDir` into a validated `PathManifest[]`.
 *
 * Walks `manifestsDir` recursively (variable-depth, R2 — `careers/<arc>/<role>.json` and
 * `skills/<subject>.json` both resolve through the same walk, with no depth-specific code path),
 * parses each `.json` file, and validates it through the upstream `PathManifestSchema` — **this
 * repository defines no validation of its own**: a manifest that would not load in production
 * cannot load in a test either. After schema validation, every `courseOrder` entry is checked
 * against `libraryCourseIds` via the upstream, pure `checkManifestIntegrity`.
 *
 * Per-file isolation (no batch-wide throw): `loadRoutePathData` calls this from the **root**
 * `[locale]` layout, which sits above the only `error.tsx` in the tree
 * (`app/[locale]/(content)/error.tsx`) — Next.js error boundaries cannot catch a throw from an
 * *ancestor* layout, so a throw here would 500 the entire site, not just the offending manifest's
 * page. A malformed manifest file (bad JSON, a `PathManifestSchema` violation, or an unresolvable
 * `courseOrder` reference) is therefore **skipped with a logged warning** rather than aborting the
 * whole batch — every other, valid manifest file still loads.
 *
 * Returns an empty array when `manifestsDir` does not exist yet (today's real state: the directory
 * is created by the upstream schema plan but populated only once a downstream manifests plan ships
 * real data) or contains no manifest files — never an error for the "no manifests yet" case.
