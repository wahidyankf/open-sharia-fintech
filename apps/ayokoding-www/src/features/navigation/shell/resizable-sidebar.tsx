/**
 * Client wrapper bridging the async server `ContentLayout` to the client-only
 * `ResizablePanel` primitive (which internally wires `useResizableWidth`).
 *
 * Renders the docs sidebar's `<aside>` shell itself — hidden below `md`, a
 * sticky rail from `md` up — with `ResizablePanel` nested inside it
 * (providing width + the drag/keyboard handle), rather than the reverse.
 * `<aside>` itself owns no overflow: its only child (`ResizablePanel`, given
 * `className="h-full"`) is stretched to exactly `<aside>`'s fixed height by
 * flexbox, so it never exceeds `<aside>`'s own box. `ResizablePanel`'s content
 * wrapper (`resizable-panel-content`) stays `overflow-hidden` by design (see
 * `resizable-panel.tsx`) as a width-bleed guard. Vertical scroll instead lives
 * on the div immediately inside it below — stretched to that same fixed
 * height via `h-full`, so it scrolls its own (potentially tall) content
 * without ever needing `resizable-panel-content` itself to overflow.
 * `overflow-x-hidden` is required alongside `overflow-y-auto` there: per the
 * CSS overflow spec, setting only `overflow-y` to non-`visible` makes
 * `overflow-x` compute to `auto` too, which would silently duplicate
 * `sidebar-tree.tsx`'s own horizontal scroll one level deeper. `<aside>`
 * deliberately has no `border-r` of its own — the `ResizablePanel` handle
 * already renders the sidebar/content boundary, and a second static border on
 * the same edge produced an unintentional compound double-border with no
 * visible seam between the two (see DWT-003 in this plan's rule-15 retest).
