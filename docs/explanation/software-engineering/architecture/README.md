# Architecture

Architecture is how a product's moving parts stay understandable as it grows. Start here when you need a shared picture of the system, a home for a business rule, or a clear boundary before implementation gets underway.

## Overview

People looking at the same product need different levels of detail: a product partner needs the big picture; an engineer needs the boundary they can safely change. This area combines complementary practices that address both needs:

1. **C4 Architecture Model** - Visual communication of software architecture through hierarchical diagrams
2. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** - Strategic and tactical patterns for modeling complex business domains

These approaches work together to help teams design, communicate, and implement robust software systems that align with business needs while maintaining technical excellence.

## Why Architecture Documentation Matters

Clear architecture documentation delivers tangible benefits:

- **Clearer onboarding** - New developers can form a useful mental model before they make a change
- **Better Communication** - Stakeholders, developers, and domain experts share a common visual language
- **Reduced Technical Debt** - Explicit boundaries and responsibilities prevent "big ball of mud" architectures
- **Confident Evolution** - Teams make changes knowing the ripple effects and integration points

### 🎨 [C4 Architecture Model](./c4-architecture-model/README.md) — visualizing software architecture through hierarchical abstraction levels

**Visualizing software architecture through hierarchical abstraction levels**

The C4 model provides a systematic way to create architecture diagrams at four levels of detail (Context, Container, Component, Code). Created by Simon Brown, it offers a developer-friendly alternative to heavyweight modeling approaches.

**Use C4 when you need to:**

- Create clear, consistent architecture diagrams for diverse audiences
- Document systems at multiple levels of abstraction
- Communicate technical decisions to both developers and stakeholders
- Maintain lightweight but rigorous architecture documentation

### 🏛️ [Domain-Driven Design (DDD)](./domain-driven-design-ddd/README.md) — strategic and tactical patterns for modeling complex business domains

**Strategic and tactical patterns for modeling complex business domains**

Domain-Driven Design places the business domain at the center of software design. Introduced by Eric Evans in 2003, DDD helps teams manage complexity in large-scale systems.

DDD provides two complementary pattern sets: strategic design for understanding the business and tactical patterns for implementing the domain model.

**Use DDD when you have:**

- Complex business logic with numerous rules and invariants
- Access to domain experts for collaboration
- Long-lived systems expected to evolve over years
- High cost of defects or regulatory compliance requirements

### ⬡ [Hexagonal Architecture](./hexagonal-architecture/README.md) — OSE Platform port, adapter, composition root, and testing conventions

**OSE Platform port, adapter, composition root, and testing conventions**

Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) isolates the domain core from all infrastructure concerns. OSE Platform conventions govern port naming and ownership, adapter package placement and forbidden imports, composition root wiring for F#/Giraffe, and the port-contract-test pattern that maps to Nx `test:unit` / `test:integration` targets.

**Use Hexagonal Architecture conventions when you are:**

- Designing a new port interface for an OrganicLever bounded context
- Implementing a database, messaging, or HTTP adapter
- Wiring adapters in an F# composition root
- Writing port contract tests or setting up an in-memory adapter for `test:unit`

### 🔄 [Finite State Machine (FSM)](./finite-state-machine-fsm/README.md) — standards for entity lifecycle management using finite state machines

**Standards for entity lifecycle management using finite state machines**

Finite State Machines provide a formal model for managing entity lifecycle transitions with explicit states, events, and guards. OSE Platform uses FSMs for modeling domain entity lifecycles, workflow state management, and business process automation.

**Use FSM when you have:**

- Entities with well-defined lifecycle states (e.g., order: pending → confirmed → shipped)
- Business processes requiring explicit state transition rules
- Domain logic that depends on current state
- Need for auditable state history

### 🧩 [DDD + Hexagonal In Practice](./ddd-hexagonal-in-practice/README.md) — OSE Platform conventions for combining DDD with Hexagonal Architecture

**OSE Platform conventions for combining DDD with Hexagonal Architecture**

Strategic DDD (bounded contexts, context maps) and tactical DDD (aggregates, value objects, domain events) integrate cleanly with Hexagonal port-and-adapter structure. OSE Platform conventions govern bounded-context-to-port mapping, aggregate-port boundaries, cross-context integration via domain events and ACLs, and module organization for F#/Giraffe backends.

**Use these conventions when you are:**

- Mapping a new bounded context onto port/adapter structure for OrganicLever
- Deciding aggregate-to-port boundaries and write-port granularity
- Designing cross-context integration with domain events, ACL, OHS, or sagas
- Organizing modules/packages for a combined DDD + Hexagonal codebase

## How C4 and DDD Work Together

C4 and DDD complement each other throughout the design process:

| DDD Concept             | Maps to C4 Level | Purpose                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Context Maps**        | System Context   | Shows how bounded contexts relate to external systems         |
| **Bounded Contexts**    | Containers       | Each bounded context typically becomes one or more containers |
| **Aggregates**          | Components       | Major aggregates often become components within a container   |
| **Domain Events**       | Dynamic Diagrams | Event flows visualized across components and containers       |
| **Ubiquitous Language** | Diagram Labels   | Consistent terminology across all diagrams                    |

**Example workflow:**

1. Use **Event Storming** (DDD) to discover domain events and bounded contexts
2. Create **Context Map** (DDD) showing relationships between bounded contexts
3. Draw **System Context diagram** (C4) showing bounded contexts as containers
4. Design **Aggregates** (DDD) within each bounded context
5. Create **Component diagrams** (C4) showing aggregates and their relationships
6. Document **runtime behaviour** with Dynamic diagrams (C4) and Domain Events (DDD)

See DDD and C4 Integration for examples and guidance.
