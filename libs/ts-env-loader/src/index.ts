/**
 * Loads exactly one `.env.<tier>` file per the repo-wide `APP_ENV` tier convention, selected by
 * `APP_ENV` (default `"local"`). Each consuming app wires `loadTierEnv()` as the very first
 * statement of its own composition root (e.g. `next.config.ts`'s first import, before `./env.ts`)
 * — this module never calls itself on import, since a library that auto-loads its own tier file on
 * import would silently compete with the app's own loader (see `tech-docs.md`'s "libraries never
 * load env files" rule).
 *
 * This module also owns one guard Next.js itself doesn't provide: Next's own env loader
 * (`@next/env`) auto-loads a bare `.env`, and in a production build also `.env.production`, IN
 * ADDITION to whatever tier file an app loads explicitly. Left unchecked, that silent extra file
 * would violate rule 2 below, so `loadTierEnv` throws if any stray file exists beside the tier file
 * at a non-local tier (the "local" exemption is explained on `assertNoStrayEnvFile` below).
 *
 * `.env.local` is the sharpest of the three stray filenames: Next.js auto-loads it in EVERY
 * environment, not just production, and that auto-load runs before `next.config.ts` is even
 * evaluated — so its values are already in `process.env` by the time a consuming app's
 * `loadTierEnv()` call (with `override: false`) runs, silently winning over an explicit
 * `.env.stag`/`.env.prod` with no error. A developer testing a non-local tier locally (exactly the
 * scenario this guard protects) always has a `.env.local` on disk.
 *
 * The five loader rules (identical across every app in this repo that consumes this module):
 *   1. Tier selector    — read APP_ENV; unset means "local".
 *   2. One file         — load .env.$APP_ENV and no other tier file.
 *   3. Process env wins — a variable already present in the process environment is never
 *                         replaced by a file value.
 *   4. Missing file is not an error — absence is the normal CI case.
 *   5. Fail loudly on required-but-absent config, not on the missing file itself — that's each
 *      app's own validation layer's job (e.g. zod's `createEnv()`), unchanged by this module.

  // only fills in keys the file defines that the target doesn't already have. That is exactly rule
  // 3 ("process env wins"): every key `env` already carries before this call survives unchanged;
  // only unset keys get the tier file's value.
  //
  // A missing tier file is not treated as an error either (rule 4): dotenv's `configDotenv()`
  // catches the file-read failure internally and reports it only via the returned `.error` field —
  // it never throws — so this function doesn't need to special-case a missing file itself.
  //
  // `env` is typed as `EnvRecord` (`string | undefined` values) to match `process.env`; dotenv's
  // own `DotenvPopulateInput` type requires `string` values, so the cast below is necessary. It's
  // safe: dotenv only ever assigns to keys it read as strings from the parsed file, and reads via
  // `hasOwnProperty` (which doesn't care whether an existing value is `undefined`).
