/// `restrict-env-access-to-prod-and-stag` plan's `tech-docs.md` "The APP_ENV
/// loader contract" for the full rationale. Agent-restricted tiers
/// (`.env.stag`, `.env.prod`) never need to be opened by an AI agent, while
/// process environment variables set by CI always take precedence over any

/// process-env-wins / missing-file-is-not-an-error semantics), adapted for
/// F#.
